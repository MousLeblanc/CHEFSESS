CHAPTER 9
 NUT MILKS, SEED MILKS, AND
 DAIRY-FREE SHAKES
 Nuts and seeds are a great alternative to making dairy-free plant-based
 milks. It has even been said that dairy can be dangerous for your health.
 Dairy avoidance is wise for preventing and healing cancer. However, if you
 feel strongly that dairy will help you in your healing, I fully advise you to
 make sure it is organic, so it comes without the growth hormones. It would
 be ideal to find a local farmer who sells fresh milk. It’s important to see the
 state of the farm, so you know where the milk is coming from.
HOMEMADE NUT MILK AND SEED MILK
 This recipe makes a delicious and refreshing dairy-free milk base! It’s way
 better than purchasing from the store because it is free of additives, such as
 sweeteners, preservatives, and thickeners. When you make your own plant
based milk, you see everything that goes into it.
 You can add other ingredients to make different flavors.
 Total time: less than 5 minutes
 Makes 4 servings
 Ingredients:
 1 cup of nuts or seeds or grains (almonds, cashews, macadamia nuts, Brazil
 nuts, hemp seeds, flaxseeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, rice, oats, or
 tigernuts)
 4 cups filtered water
 ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
 4 seedless dates, optional (or use figs, 1 tablespoon honey, or maple syrup)
 Pinch of sea salt
 Actions:
 Put all the ingredients in a blender and mix together until a smooth, milky
 consistency is achieved. Drink.
 Tips:
 For a creamier and smoother milk, soak your nuts or seeds for 4 hours.
 For example, when the almond skin becomes soft from soaking, you
 can pop the almonds right out of their skins before blending. Then you
 can drain the nut or seed milk with a cheesecloth to remove all the
 fiber.
Make a batch of nut or seed milk every Saturday so you have your
 own homemade milk all week. This will save you from consuming the
 preservatives that are found in store-bought nut milks. And, it will save
 you a bunch of money!
 Variations—add these ingredients to the above recipe:
 Add 3 tablespoons of cacao powder for Chocolate Milk.
 Add 1 cup strawberries for Strawberry Milk.
 Add 1 teaspoon cinnamon.

SIMPLE VANILLA BANANA SMOOTHIE
 This is the base to make a simple classic smoothie. Using frozen bananas
 (be sure to freeze them without the skin) makes a thick, smooth, and chilled
 smoothie. Then you can add any ingredients you like for other flavors such
 as a Chocolate Smoothie or Strawberry Smoothie.
 Total time: 10 minutes
 Makes 2 servings
 Ingredients:
 1 cup plant-based milk (any type)
 2 frozen bananas
 3 seedless dates
 Pinch of sea salt
 Dash of vanilla extract
 Actions:
 Put all the ingredients in a blender and blend on high speed until the
 mixture reaches a smooth consistency.
 Variations:
 Add 1 ½ teaspoons cacao powder for a Chocolate Smoothie.
 Add 1 ½ teaspoons cacao powder and 2 tablespoons peanut butter for a

 To freeze a banana, peel it first, then wrap it in plastic wrap and place it in
 the freezer. This makes it easier when you are ready to make smoothies or
 instant ice cream: Just grab it out of the freezer, unwrap, and blend!

THE SMOOTHIE CURE
 Kelly Brogan, M.D., is an advocate for “healing your brain by changing
 your breakfast.” She says, “People often ask me what I eat for breakfast. If
 you’re looking for a quick and easy recipe to improve brain health and
 functioning, and give you energy to spare, try this smoothie. Loaded with
 healthy fats, lecithin, protein, and antioxidants, this smoothie packs a
 serious punch—and it tastes great!” Kelly is a Manhattan-based holistic
 women’s health psychiatrist, author of the New York Times best-selling
 book, A Mind of Your Own: The Truth About Depression and How Women
 Can Heal Their Bodies to Reclaim Their Lives, and co-editor of the
 landmark textbook, Integrative Therapies for Depression: Redefining
 Models for Assessment, Treatment and Prevention. She completed her
 psychiatric training and fellowship at New York University Medical Center
 after graduating from Cornell University Medical College, and has a B.S.
 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in systems neuroscience. In
 regard to cancer, Kelly says, “There is nothing to fight. There is no war to
 declare. In fact, it is the posture of aligning with the good to fight the bad
 that is keeping us stuck, tired, and losing precious ground. The sooner we
 recognize that what we are calling other is us, the sooner we heal. Cancer is
 a wise mechanism on the part of a body, mind, and spirit. It is a means of
 communicating a desperate message, a signal of danger, and a mandate for
 change. Change in relationships, in diet, in toxic exposures, and often, an
 indication that it is time to unearth old secrets, heal past trauma, and give
 voice to suppressed anger. It is, as all diagnoses, an invitation to be initiated
 to your more whole, healed self.”

A SPLASH OF SUNSHINE SMOOTHIE
 This recipe comes from holistic health practitioner Sarah Anne Stewart,
 AADP, who is the daughter of Bill and Linda Stewart. Sarah was 14 when
 her father was diagnosed with cancer and her family decided as a unit that
 they would change their eating habits. They were successful, and Bill
 became cancer-free. Sarah was positively affected and inspired for a
 lifetime to eat and drink nourishing, nutrient-rich foods. This is one of
 Sarah’s favorite smoothies loaded with anticancer ingredients. It is both
 anti-inflammatory and high in protein.

THE CHEMO BRAIN BUSTER
 CC Webster, author of So, That Happened, drank this smoothie every
 morning to get through her courses of chemotherapy. Chemo brain is a term
 people use to describe difficulty concentrating, confusion, being unusually
 disoriented, struggling to find the right word, difficulty learning new skills
 or multitasking, fatigue from thinking, and any feeling of mental fogginess
 from mild to severe.1 CC says this smoothie “brought my words back to
 me.”
 The secret of the smoothie is that it is rich in the highest-quality omega-3
 and omega-6 fats. What’s the science? The brain is one of the systems of
 the body that is MOST reliant on cell turnover. It needs to regenerate itself
 to continue making high-speed connections, to sift through memories for
 deductive reasoning, to dream and plan, and to facilitate word recall.
 Without fresh, new cells, neurotransmitter activity simply doesn’t work.
 Chemo stops cell regeneration in its tracks, and with that your dreams, your
 memories, and your words are also affected. Healthy fats nourish your brain
 and coat it with literal brain food. CC still drinks this every morning! She is
 two years cancer-free.

CHAPTER 11
 DETOXING TEAS AND
 CLEANSING WATERS
 During the cancer healing process, one easy way to ensure we are getting
 constant hydration, nourishment, and detox aid is to be drinking herbal teas
 and cleansing waters regularly. In between the juices and foods that I was
 consuming every day, I was also drinking a lot of herbal tea, mostly lemon
 myrtle with myrtle that came straight from a tree in my backyard. If you
 have a tree or plant that you can access from your own garden this is even
 better and more powerful for healing. If not, you can purchase teas.
 Here are some easy cleansing waters that you can keep in your fridge, or
 even pour into ice cube trays and place in the freezer—then they are ready
 to pop out and add to filtered drinking water at any time.
IMMUNE-BOOSTING TURMERIC BLACK PEPPER TEA
 This stimulating tea offers a great way to get your daily dose of the
 turmeric-and-black pepper remedy.
 Total time: 10 minutes
 Makes 1 serving
 Ingredients:
 2 cups filtered water
 1-inch piece of ginger, diced
 1 garlic clove, diced
 Pinch of cayenne pepper (the beverage should be spicy but comfortable to
 drink)
 ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
 Dash of black pepper
 1 lemon
 1 tablespoon raw honey (optional)
 Actions:
 1. Bring the water, ginger, garlic, cayenne pepper, turmeric, and black
 pepper to boil in a saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer
 for 7 minutes.
 2. Strain the liquid as you pour it into a teacup.
 3. Squeeze in the juice of the lemon, add honey, if using, and stir well.
 4. Drink warm.

ANTI-INFLAMMATORY GINGER TEA
 If you have cancer, or want to prevent cancer, always have some fresh
 ginger root in your home. You can cut it up and boil it to make a ginger tea.
 I recommend drinking a ginger tea every night before bed. Ginger is an
 incredibly powerful anti-inflammatory and assists in reducing pain, cramps,
 aches, and bloating. It also suppresses appetite, so it can help curb sugar
 cravings at nighttime.
 Total time: 10 minutes
 Makes 2 servings
 Ingredients:
 4 cups filtered water
 2-inch piece of ginger, diced
 Actions:
 1. Boil the water and ginger in a saucepan for 7 minutes.
 2. Strain the liquid as you pour it into teacups.
 3. Drink warm.

 Make a huge batch, and then let it cool and later place in the fridge so the
 next day you have Ginger Water.

 helpful for neuropathy, which can be a side effect of chemotherapy.

ENERGY TEA
 This energizing combo of green tea, mint, and ginseng is bound to leave

 erectile dysfunction.1 In Chinese medicine, ginseng is also used as an
 antidepressant quite effectively.2

RELAXING BEDTIME TEA
 All its ingredients make this a relaxation tonic. Even just chamomile is a
 relaxing bedtime tea in itself, if you aren’t able to get the other ingredients.
 Chamomile is used to soothe muscles and has been proven to be effective in
 treating spasmodic gastrointestinal disorders.3 And check this out—based
 on available data, chamomile has appeared useful in mitigating anxiety and
 depression. “Chamomile and other flowers including lavender can benefit
 cancer patients by minimizing medication load and accompanying side
 effects.”4

 sleep problems including insomnia; it also may alleviate PMS symptoms.5

INFUSED WATERS
 You can infuse water with literally any fruit, vegetable, herb, or spice you
 have on hand—even edible essential oils in moderation. You can infuse
 them on their own or together. One reason why you would infuse your
 water is to add nutrients, and the other—main reason—is for flavor. Staying
 hydrated is helpful to your elimination systems.
 Some ideas:
 Orange slices
 Lemon slices
 Lime slices
 Apple slices
 Halved cherries
 Halved grapes
 Raspberries
 Strawberries
 Blueberries
 Pineapple slices
 Cucumber slices
 Rosemary sprigs
 Mint leaves
 Ginger slices
 Apple cider vinegar (1 teaspoon or 1 capful per cup of water)
 Essential oils, therapeutic grade only (1 to 2 drops per cup) such as
 cinnamon, clove, copaiba, frankincense, ginger, grapefruit, lemon,
 lemongrass, orange, peppermint, and spearmint
DETOX WATER
 This is for people who find drinking plain water “boring.” If you are used to
 drinking soda, this is the recipe for you—not that it is sweet in any way, but

 extreme cleansing for your body. Woo-hoo, kick it!
 Total time: 5 minutes

 screwdriver or a sharp kitchen utensil, like a thin knife or a metal
 chopstick.
 2. Drain the coconut water into a cup or place a straw in the hole and
 drink directly from the coconut!

SEA SALT FLUSH
 Sea salt is high in minerals. It’s important to use the right kind of salt,
 which I would call “real” salt, not table salt with loads of preservatives.

 gargle and clean your mouth.

BENTONITE CLAY DRINK
 Bentonite clay is ash that has accumulated from volcanoes over millions of
 years. This remarkable clay has magnetic properties that can assist us in
 expelling impurities, toxins, worms, parasites, and heavy metals from the
 blood, gut, and body. It is a natural chelator that absorbs toxins so they can
 be excreted safely. Bentonite clay contains an abundance of minerals,
 including magnesium, calcium, iron, potassium, and silica.
 There are some great studies on bentonite clay and cancer, including one
 that talks about chickens with an accumulation of carcinogens in their
 tissue. After treatment, the chickens that received bentonite clay had
 reduced levels of aflatoxins in their livers and increased longevity.
 This is one of the known benefits of drinking bentonite clay—it assists
 the liver in the natural detoxification process to ensure toxins are kept out.
 The clay absorbs toxins, which are then expelled with the remnants of the
 clay when we poop.
 Based on different studies, here are two things the clay does.
 An in vitro study showed the clay inhibits the growth of spinal cord
 and brain tumors (glioblastomas).6
 Researchers tested the urine of people in an at-risk population and
 found that the clay reduces the bioavailability of carcinogens
 (aflatoxins and fumonisins). It reduces our risk of liver cancer
 (hepatocellular carcinoma) and esophageal cancer.7
 Use a wooden spoon to mix the clay into the water, because a metal
 utensil will change the molecular structure. (See Resources for suppliers.)
 Total time: 5 minutes
 Makes 1 serving
 Ingredients:
 1 teaspoon bentonite clay
 1 cup filtered water
Actions:
 Use a wooden spoon to mix the clay into the water, stirring until there are
 no lumps.
 Tip:
 If you let this drink sit for 30 minutes before stirring, lumps often dissolve
 on their own, making it possible to achieve a smoother consistency.

CHAPTER 12
 EASY, BREEZY BREAKFASTS
 Breakfast is your first meal of the day, so it can define your energy and the
 quality of your self-care. People can be too rigid in their definition of the
 ideal breakfast. It’s okay to eat a salad for breakfast! You could add some
 eggs to your salad: fried, poached, scrambled, soft-boiled, or hard-boiled to
 add some more protein and breakfast vibes. Eggs can be a much easier
 protein to digest than meats for some cancer patients. You can also have a
 smoothie or smoothie bowl for breakfast. The following recipes include
 sweet and savory combinations. They are super easy and simple to prepare
 and great when you are low in energy—especially overnight oats.
CHIA SEED CEREAL
 Chia seeds are a great way to start the day! You can make this cereal the
 night before so that in the morning the seeds are soft and swelled up like a
 pudding. Chia seeds are extremely comforting and can feel like a lighter
 “gluten” in the digestive system, helping you to crave less actual gluten like
 bread. There are also hundreds of articles on chia seeds detailing benefits
 such as decreased blood glucose; decreased waist, bloating, and weight in
 overweight adults; and improvements in pruritic skin and endurance in
 distance runners have been recorded.1 This cereal can help fuel your body
 to be able to heal cancer!
 Total time: 10 minutes
 Makes 1 serving
 Ingredients:
 3 tablespoons chia seeds
 ½ cup filtered water, nut milk, or Sunflower Seed Milk
 Your choice of chopped fruit: 1 apple, banana, peach, pear, or nectarine, or
 ½ cup berries
 Actions:
 1. Place the chia seeds and liquid into a cereal bowl. Soak for 5 minutes.
 2. Add the fruit and eat.
 Tip:
 Add 1 teaspoon of raw honey, maple syrup, or chopped dates for a sweeter
 cereal.
 Variations:
Chia Hemp Seed Cereal: add 1 tablespoon hemp seeds.
 Oatmeal Chia Seed Cereal: add 1 tablespoon oats.

CHOCOLATE COCONUT MOUSSE
 You can make this recipe, along with the Overnight Oats and Blueberry
 Chia Seed Jam, and stack it in a jar to make a beautiful breakfast parfait.
 This is my favorite combination because you have the savory overnight oats
 at the bottom, then a layer of decadent mousse, topped with another layer of
 oats or some fresh fruit like strawberries and blueberries, then finished with
 some jam, a sweet-tart fruity way to complete the jar. You can make up to
 three of these and take them with you to work—so sweet and so
 convenient!
 Total time: 5 minutes
 Makes 4 servings
 Ingredients:
 1 can 13.5 oz coconut cream
 2 tablespoons cacao powder
 6 seedless dates
 ¼ teaspoon vanilla
 1 tablespoon MCT oil or coconut oil
 Smidgen of sea salt
 Actions:
 Add all ingredients to a high-speed blender and whip until completely
 combined. It will be melted, so set in the fridge in jars or an airtight
 container for 2 hours until it’s set and smooth like mousse.

STEEL-CUT OVERNIGHT OATS
 A five-minute recipe that you can leave in the fridge overnight and enjoy
 the next morning—woo-hoo! You can make these oats as many as three
 days ahead.
 Total time: 5 minutes and setting overnight
 Makes 1 serving
 Ingredients:
 ½ cup steel-cut oats
 ¼ cup filtered water
 ¼ cup almond milk
 ⅛ teaspoon vanilla
 1 tablespoon chia seeds (If you can’t do chia seeds, add an extra tablespoon
 of steel-cut oats.)
 Smidgen of sea salt
 Actions:
 1. Add all the ingredients to a jar and stir until well combined.
 2. Place in the fridge and enjoy the next day with some toppings.
 Tips:
 Add these as toppings: cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, cacao powder,
 cacao nibs, cashews, walnuts, pistachios, granola, shredded coconut,
 blueberries, strawberries, kiwi.
 You can use regular whole oats instead of steel-cut, but they expand
 more so use this recipe with ½ cup oats and do 1 cup of liquid.

SUPER SCRAMBLED EGGS
 This is a great go-to for a quick breakfast, but also convenient for lunch,
 dinner, or a snack. All the cancer survivors I interviewed for this book
 confirmed how helpful it is to be able to make a quick meal in 10 minutes
 or less so they could reserve their energy for healing and absorbing
 nutrients and protein from the food. I add a handful of greens because I am
 always looking for more ways to add greens to my diet. You can add any
 spices or herbs that you like to this recipe. (I’ve included my favorite
 anticancer ingredients.) And don’t be afraid of the egg yolks! They provide
 good, healthy fats that the brain and body need during healing.
 Total time: 10 minutes
 Makes 1 serving
 Ingredients:
 3 eggs
 1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin coconut oil or olive oil
 Pinch of turmeric
 Pinch of black pepper
 Pinch of cayenne pepper
 Pinch of paprika
 Pinch of thyme
 Pinch of rosemary
 Pinch of sea salt
 Actions:
 1. Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk with a fork.
 2. Heat the coconut oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Make sure that
 the oil covers the entire bottom of the pan—if not, add more oil. When
 the oil is hot, pour in the eggs and then add the spices.
3. Cook for a few minutes until the bottom begins to firm, then mash
 with a fork to scramble the eggs.

MEDITERRANEAN OMELET
 The eating habits of people from the Mediterranean region have been
 proven to reduce the risk of cancer, including breast cancer. Their meals
 incorporate plenty of good fats from eggs, olives, olive oil, and fish, as well
 as veggies and whole grains. They tend to snack on nuts, have fruit for
 dessert, and enjoy some red wine. The Cancer-Free with Food plan includes
 these ingredients.

CHAPTER 13
 ENERGIZING LUNCHES AND
 HEALING DINNERS
 If it’s made in a garden, eat it. If it’s made in a
 lab, then it takes a lab to digest.
 — KRIS CARR
 We can agree that a plant-rich diet is ideal for healing and preventing
 cancer. This chapter focuses on alkalizing raw vegan meals and cooked
 vegan meals that will amplify your energy. Our bodies were not designed to
 digest a lot of chemicals, toxins, preservatives, or additives. Sure, they are
 strong and resilient. But in the contemporary world, they simply have had
 to endure chemical exposure for years, both from our food supply and from
 the environment, and frankly, that toxic overload is making us sick. This is
 what the cancer statistics are showing!
 The recipes here feature a mixture of easily digestible and nutrient-rich
 ingredients—lunch and dinner dishes that will nourish any body. There are
 a combination of soups and salads; raw vegan, cooked vegan meals, and
 cooked vegetarian entrées; broths; and recipes for meat eaters here.
WALNUT “MEATBALLS”
 For when you are craving meatballs but want to skip on the red meat, these
 are a tasty creative alternative that are surprisingly delicious and even
 appealing to meat eaters.
 Total time: 10 minutes
 Makes 4 servings
 Ingredients:
 1 ½ cups walnuts
 1 cup sundried tomatoes
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
 1 tablespoon fresh sage
 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
 1 teaspoon fresh thyme
 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary
 1 teaspoon fresh marjoram
 Pinch of black pepper
 Pinch of cayenne pepper
 Pinch of sea salt
 Actions:
 Add all the ingredients to a blender and mix for 5 minutes or until well
 combined.
 Tips:
 If you do not have a blender, you can make this recipe using a mortar
 and pestle. Crush the walnuts first, then dice the sundried tomatoes and
add both to a bowl. Add in the remaining ingredients and stir until the
 mixture is moist enough to stick together.
 This recipe can be used as the meat to make a “raw burger,” “raw
 tacos,” Zucchini Spaghetti with Raw Tomato Sauce and Walnut
 “Meatballs”, or Raw Lasagna.

RAW LASAGNA
 Total time: 40 minutes
 Makes 12 servings
 Ingredients:
 Walnut “Meatballs”
 Cashew Cheese
 2 large zucchinis
 1 tablespoon dried oregano, divided (for sprinkling)
 1 cup fresh spinach
 1 cup fresh basil
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
 Actions:
 1. Prepare the Walnut “Meatballs” and the Cashew Cheese.
 2. Peel and slice the zucchini into thin strips with a vegetable peeler.
 Place the first layer of zucchini in a deep lasagna dish (or 8 x 11 ½ x 2
inch baking dish) that holds 2 quarts. Layer the zucchini so that the
 strips are just overlapping each other. You could also build the lasagna
 directly on plates if you will be eating it immediately. Sprinkle ½
 tablespoon of oregano over the zucchini strips.
 3. Layer ½ of the Walnut “Meatballs” over the zucchini.
 4. Spread ½ cup Cashew Cheese over the Walnut “Meatballs.”
 5. Place ½ cup each of spinach and basil leaves over the Cashew Cheese.
 6. Add another layer of zucchini strips. (Keep in mind that you will need
 1 more layer for the top of the lasagna.)
 7. Repeat the layering of the Walnut “Meatballs,” Cashew Cheese,
 spinach, and basil.
8. Add the last layer of zucchini strips and sprinkle the remaining ½
 tablespoon of oregano on top. Finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin
 olive oil.
 9. The lasagna is now ready to eat, but if you allow it to set in the
 refrigerator overnight it will be easier to slice.
 Tips:
 If you want to add more layers, use the pesto sauce from the Pasta
 Pesto recipe or the Raw Tomato Sauce.
 The lasagna keeps well in the fridge for 4 to 5 days.
 If you want a spicy lasagna, sprinkle cayenne pepper on one of the
 layers.

CAULIFLOWER CRUST MINI PIZZAS
 This recipe is from my good friend chiropractor David Jockers, D.N.M,
 D.C., who says, “One of the most common complaints I get from people is
 that they can no longer eat pizza or must restrict their pizza intake when
 they begin a keto program. I always respond by saying that they just have to
 get more creative and innovative. Using a cauliflower crust makes this
 grain-free and anti-inflammatory for the body! This is a fantastic recipe for
 a true pizza flavor and texture without all the nasty inflammatory carbs and
 toxic fats. You get tons of incredible nutrients in this recipe, healthy fats and
 antioxidants. This is a whole-superfood-based meal that the family will love
 and enjoy for many meals to come!”
 Total time: 40 minutes
 Makes 8 servings (1 mini pizza each)

 2 teaspoon dried parsley
 2 teaspoons dried basil
 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
 2 garlic cloves, minced
 Toppings of your choice:
 Raw Tomato Sauce
 Cheese (organic dairy or vegan)
 Pesto
 Tomatoes
Olives
 Actions:
 1. For the mini pizza crusts, steam the cauliflower, then grate, rice, or
 chop it finely. (You can do this in a food processor a few pieces at a
 time.)
 2. Beat the eggs in a bowl, then add the cauliflower and shredded cheese
 and mix together.
 3. Press 8 large spoonfuls of the cauliflower mixture onto a cookie sheet
 covered with parchment paper.

BEAN BURGERS
 Beans are way underrated and we need to hype them up! They are so
 incredibly good for us and something everyone could incorporate more into
 their diet. In fact, beans have been proven to reduce the risk of breast
 cancer.2
 Total time: 20 minutes
 Makes 4 servings
 Ingredients:
 One 15-ounce can organic beans (butter beans or black beans work best; or
 you can soak dry beans overnight, then boil them for an hour or until soft
 instead of using canned)
 ½ cup almond meal (blended almond)
 1 small yellow onion, chopped
 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
 2 tablespoons broccoli sprouts, diced
 1 teaspoon black seeds
 ½ teaspoon cumin
 ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
 ¼ teaspoon fennel
 ¼ teaspoon thyme
 ¼ teaspoon sage
 ¼ teaspoon sea salt
 ¼ teaspoon black pepper
 ⅛ teaspoon turmeric
 Pinch of cayenne pepper

 ingredients, except for the oil. Taste the mixture and add more spices
 or sea salt to your liking. Divide the mixture into 4 equal parts and
 shape into 4 patties.
 2. Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat. Fry the patties until
 golden, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side.
 3. Serve on Gluten Free Tortillas, or Teff Crepes kale, collard greens, or
 lettuce. The burgers taste great with herbs like fresh parsley, cilantro,
 and basil.
 Tips:
 Nonvegans can use 1 egg in this recipe instead of the Flax Egg
 Alternative.
 This meal goes great with Ketchup.
 Variations:
 Add extra cayenne pepper for Spicy Bean Burgers.
 Roll the mixture into 10 balls for Bean Balls. Serve on brown rice
 pasta, Pasta Primavera, or Zucchini Pasta.

ANITA MOORJANI’S COCONUT CURRY!
 The story of Anita Moorjani is known worldwide. Anita is the epitome of
 what is possible, that it truly is never too late to be healed from cancer. I
 had the opportunity to talk to Anita about her rock-bottom experience,
 which turned into a transformation. After four years of battling cancer, and
 with a body riddled with tumors, some the size of lemons, Anita lay dying
 in the intensive care unit in the hospital, where she dropped into a coma.
 The doctors told her husband it was too late, there was nothing more they
 could do for her.
 During the coma, Anita had a near-death experience. She recalls, “I
 experienced the state of love and realized we are truly love.” This led her to
 reenter her body and initiate the healing of her cancer. As her tumors
 rapidly shrank, the doctors could barely believe it. A mere four days later,
 Anita left the hospital. She has been cancer-free and living ever so happily
 since then. Her explanation for what occurred? Love heals cancer.
 This curry is delicious for both vegetarians or fish and meat eaters.
 What’s her secret ingredient? Love.
 Ingredients:
 ½ red onion, coarsely chopped
 4 garlic cloves, minced
 1 tablespoon coconut oil or ghee
 6 whole cloves
 1 pound meat protein (chicken, beef, lamb), fish, or shrimp (optional)
 4 cups vegetables of your choice, diced (squash, eggplant, zucchini, carrots,
 broccoli, string beans, baby corn, cauliflower, peas, or whatever else your
 favorites are!)
 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
 1 heaping teaspoon curry powder
 1 cup coconut cream
 1 stock cube dissolved in ¼ cup of warm filtered water (your choice of
 either chicken or vegetable stock, or freshly made stock)
1 ton love
 Actions:
 1. Stir-fry the onions and garlic in the coconut oil or ghee until tender.
 2. Add the cloves (and if you are adding meat, this is the point to do so).
 3. Add the vegetables and stir-fry everything for another 2 to 3 minutes.
 4. Add the turmeric powder and curry powder. Continue to stir-fry for
 another 2 to 3 minutes to allow the flavors to absorb. If you have
 added meat, continue to stir-fry until the meat is fully cooked.
 5. Add the coconut cream, bring to boil, and allow to simmer for about 5
 minutes.
 6. Add ¼ cup stock and allow to simmer for another 15 minutes or
 longer. Anita says the longer you leave the curry to simmer, the better
 it tastes.
 7. Serve on a bed of white or brown rice or quinoa, and add sea salt to
 taste.
 Tips:
 If you like your curry hot and spicy, add 1 coarsely chopped serrano
 pepper.
 One more thing: Don’t eat the cloves. They enhance the flavor of the
 curry but are not great when chewed. Take them out before serving or
 just avoid them when eating the curry.
 This curry tastes even better the next day, so the leftovers are fabulous!

MAC ’N’ CHEESE
 This is a healthy spin on the traditional Mac ’n’ Cheese, but without the
 dairy or gluten. So, you can feel much lighter after enjoying this dish! It’s
 the method of cooking with the exact amount of 3 ¼ cups of water and then
 not draining it out afterward, along with the nutritional yeast, that gives it a
 creamy, cheesy flavor and texture. Nutritional yeast is a popular
 replacement for cheese for vegans and vegetarians. In Australia, the same
 ingredient might be known as savory yeast flakes. You can also use
 nutritional yeast in mashed potatoes, hash browns, on eggs, in soups, and on
 roasted cauliflower (see the Cauliflower Popcorn recipe).
 Nutritional yeast is a byproduct of the production of sugar cane or beet
 molasses. It has 16 amino acids and a full spectrum of B vitamins.
 Total time: 20 minutes
 Makes 3 servings
 Ingredients:
 2 cups uncooked gluten-free pasta (chickpea, lentil, or brown rice)
 3 ¼ cups water
 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
 1 teaspoon sea salt
 Actions:
 1. Place the pasta and water in a pot and bring to a boil over high heat.
 Stir the pasta and reduce the heat to medium-low. Keep stirring until
 the pasta is soft, 10 to 20 minutes. As it cooks, the pasta will soak up
 the water and begin to take on a creamy appearance. Note: Usually
 when we cook pasta, there is much more water in the pot and then the
 pasta is drained. But for this dish to succeed and achieve a natural
 creaminess, we need the pasta to soak up the water. The residual liquid
 in the pot will become the base for the creamy sauce, so do not drain it.
2. Add the nutritional yeast and the sea salt to the pot of pasta and stir
 until well combined with the water to form the sauce.
 Tips:
 Add 1 to 2 teaspoons thyme for flavor.
 Add 1 tablespoon coconut oil for extra smoothness and additional
 health benefits.
 Use extra nutritional yeast if you like a cheesier taste, or if needed to
 soak up some liquid.
 Variation:
 Stir in 1 tablespoon pepper at the end for Peppery Mac ’n’ Cheese.

MEATBALL CURRY
 You can make this with ground beef, lamb, chicken, or turkey. If you are up
 for it, this is a fun, soothing, and healing dish to make at your own leisure.
 It can be done in one hour, but if you want to put on some music and sip on
 some wine, you can stretch it out to two hours—and it will be well worth
 the wait and the work! It’s loaded with all the anticancer superspices,
 including turmeric, ginger, garlic, and black pepper.
 Serve over Cauliflower Rice, quinoa, or a bed of salad with broccoli.

 medium-high heat. Add the onions, garlic, and dry spices. Cook for 3
 minutes, then add the ginger. Let all the flavors combine for a few
 more minutes, then add the carrots. Lower the heat and sauté for 10
 minutes so the flavors can merge.
 2. Add the coconut milk, tomato sauce, and coconut sugar. Stir well.
 Sauté for another 10 minutes.
 3. While the curry sauce is simmering, make the meatballs. Add all the
 ingredients to a bowl and use your hands to ensure the mixture is well
 combined. Form the mixture into approximately 16 1-inch meatballs.
 Heat the oil in a fry pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the
 meatballs. Turn using tongs when one side goes golden brown. Once
 the meatballs are almost cooked through, add them to the curry sauce
 and cook together for 10 minutes.

SATTVIC (PURE) KITCHARI
 This recipe comes from Sahara Rose Ketabi’s book on ayurvedic foods, Eat
 Feel Fresh. Ayurveda is the world’s oldest medicine and closely associated
 with yoga. A holistic system that originated in India more than 5,000 years
 ago, it is based on a desire to bring the body into balance. The ayurvedic
 treatment for cancer might include abstinence from dietary and lifestyle
 elements that would cause a tridosha (vata, pitta, kapha) imbalance, herbal
 supplementation, and elimination of toxins through therapeutic practices
 known collectively as panchakarma. Ayurvedic preparations can be used as
 adjuncts to chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
 In The Idiot’s Guide to Ayurveda, Sahara explains the ayurvedic view that
 the emergence of cancer is just the body’s way of letting you know that you
 are imbalanced. The goal then is to restore balance.
 There are only three bodily constitutions, or doshas, and every person on
 earth fits in to one of these types, which are associated with elements from
 nature. Everybody possesses some of every dosha, but with one or two
 being predominant. The three doshas are:
 Vata = air + space
 Pitta = fire + water
 Kapha = earth + water
 Nutritionally speaking, each dosha has somewhat different requirements
 to remain in balance. Those are foods that make people with a specific
 dosha feel their best. In a nutshell:
 Vata should emphasize grounding root vegetables and cooked foods.
 Pitta should emphasize a combination of raw and cooked foods.
 Kapha should emphasize steamed foods, sprouts, raw foods, and bitter
 foods.
 Sahara says that if you eat the wrong foods for your body type it can
 cause many health issues. I am pitta-vata and therefore need a combination
 of raw, living foods and warming foods. If I eat too many raw foods, I
become too airy and feel cold. Fortunately, Sahara has included
 modifications in her Kitchari recipe for each of the doshas. Kitchari literally
 means grabbing items from the kitchen and throwing it all in to make a
 tasty, nourishing meal.
 Total time: 40 minutes
 Serves 4
 Ingredients:
 2 tablespoons sesame oil (vata/kapha) or coconut oil (pitta)
 1 to 2 teaspoons cumin seeds (less for pitta, more for vata/kapha)
 2 teaspoons fennel seeds
 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
 2 teaspoons ground coriander
 ½ to 1-inch piece of fresh ginger, grated (less for pitta, more for vata/kapha)
 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
 ¼ teaspoon asafetida (optional)
 4 cups filtered water
 1 cup basmati rice, soaked overnight, rinsed, and drained
 1 cup split yellow mung beans (dhal), soaked overnight, rinsed, and drained
 1 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro
 Juice of 1 lime
 For Vata:
 ½ cup diced sweet potato
 1 cup chopped mustard greens
 For Pitta:
 ½ cup chopped kale
 ½ cup diced butternut squash
For Kapha:
 ½ cup cauliflower florets
 1 cup chopped dandelion greens
 Actions:
 1. Heat the oil over medium heat in a Dutch oven. Add the cumin, fennel,
 and mustard seeds and cook for 3 minutes or until the mustard seeds
 begin to pop. Add the coriander, ginger, turmeric, and asafetida, if
 using. Stir to combine.
 2. Stir in the water, rice, mung beans, and vegetables for your dosha.
 Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring
 occasionally, until the rice and mung beans are cooked and the
 vegetables are soft, about 40 minutes.
 3. Serve warm, topped with fresh cilantro and lime juice. Kitchari can be
 refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days.

MUNG BEAN SWEET POTATO SPICED RICE
 Beans are a staple comfort food of India and used in ayurveda. This is a
 favorite of cancer survivor Pasha Hogan, author of Third Time Lucky: A
 Creative Recovery. It’s her go-to dish for protein. She says, “As a
 vegetarian, mung beans are great! I also like to make a big pot of this dish
 and have it in the fridge for a few days or freeze a few portions for later. It
 is lovely with a light salad or a piece of brown bread toasted and smeared
 with tahini and avocado. It’s very nourishing.” The Indian spices give it a
 savory, delicious taste.

CHAPTER 14
 SUPER SALADS AND DELICIOUS
 DRESSINGS
 We should all have a goal to eat at least one raw, living food each day, like a
 salad made with fresh lettuce. Granted, a juice is raw and so is a smoothie,
 but eating a salad every single day will provide you with many vital
 nutrients and enzymes you need to boost your immune system and kill
 cancer cells. Making a salad can be as simple as going out to your backyard
 and picking some lettuce, kale, cilantro, and parsley and mixing it in a bowl
 with a simple dressing like olive oil and lemon. Add some avocado,
 chickpeas, black beans—or Almond Turmeric Crusted Chicken Tenders—
 for some more substance. Alternatively, you can buy a premade organic
 salad mix from the supermarket and pour some of it into a bowl. Please
 make sure this is part of your shopping list each week: Always have fresh
 salad ingredients in your home and aim to have one salad a day if you want
 to change your health and life.
 I hope you will learn to love salads if you don’t love them yet. You just
 need to discover your soul salad—heehee! I am certain you can find it here.
 I refused to eat salads for years because I thought they were boring, then the
 Superfood Kale Salad converted me. Another benefit is that it takes time to
 eat a salad; all that chewing is helpful for your digestion and metabolism.
 Eating a salad can be like eating straight from God’s garden!

MASON JAR SALADS
 When talking about salads, Christiane Northrup, M.D., advises: “Think
 color and you’ll be on the right path, because the deep pigments in these
 foods contain powerful antioxidants. Go for broccoli; green leafy
 vegetables; berries; red, yellow, and green peppers; and tomatoes, and vary
 your choices through the seasons.”
 Salad in a jar 101: Grab your mason jar and fill it up with your salad of
 choice. You can make up seven of these once a week and then grab one
 from the fridge each day as you go off to work. Salad keeps fresh in a
 mason jar! See the story about James Lechmanski, who ate salads for
 breakfast.

 How to Build a Mason Jar Salad
 1. Start with the “wet ingredients” on the bottom. First choose your salad
 dressing. Then add things like cucumbers, red peppers, and tomatoes.
 You can also incorporate fruits like strawberries and blackberries.
 2. Then add your solid vegetables: carrots, broccoli, snap peas, beans, or
 cauliflower.
 3. Add your dry ingredients, including any nuts and seeds.
 4. Lastly, add your protein: pasta, meat, chicken, or egg.
 5. When you are ready to eat, shake it up and you’ll have a salad in a jar!
 You can either dump it into a bowl or eat it straight from the jar.

CHAPTER 15
 COMFORTING SOUPS AND
 BROTHS
 Soup can be incredibly calming, warming, and nourishing at the same time.
 By definition, a soup is a water-based dish for which a number of
 ingredients are stirred into a pot, seasoned with herbs and spices, and heated
 over a flame. And you can also add meats. If you are pressed for time or not
 feeling energetic enough to make a broth from scratch, you can buy a
 premade broth and use that as a base for your soup.
 Soup is an opportunity to stock your fridge for a week or longer with
 convenience foods. Make a big batch and freeze some in individual
 portions. Add fresh ingredients as you reheat it. Fresh parsley, cilantro,
 cucumbers, and avocados are excellent additions to make a frozen soup
 come alive again.
 Regarding the cooked soups: I prefer to cook and reheat my soups on the
 stovetop, as this preserves more of their nutritional value. Don’t use a
 microwave for reheating your soups, as it changes the nutritional structure.
 Some of the recipes that follow are raw soups and some are cooked. The
 raw soups are vegan. Some of the cooked soups call for meat. For extra
 protein, you can always add a boiled egg, beans, quinoa, or chickpeas to
 your soup.
 Any of these soups can be pureed after cooking to make them smoother
 and easier to swallow and digest.
 A broth and a stock are generally the same thing: a liquid created from
 either animal bones or vegetables. Stock is often called for in recipes that
have a base, like a soup, but you can also use a broth as a base for soup.
VEGETABLE SOUP
 Total time: 10 minutes
 Makes 4 servings
 INGREDIENTS:
 5 cups filtered water
 ½ teaspoon dried thyme or 1 tablespoon fresh thyme
 ½ teaspoon dried parsley or 1 tablespoon fresh parsley
 ½ teaspoon dried oregano
 ½ teaspoon cumin powder
 1 teaspoon sea salt
 ¼ teaspoon black pepper
 ½ head of cauliflower
 ½ head of broccoli
 1 carrot
 2 celery stalks
 Dash of cayenne pepper, optional
 Actions:
 1. Place the water, herbs, and spices in a large pot over high heat and
 bring to a boil. Meanwhile, chop the vegetables into small pieces.
 2. Add the vegetables to the pot and allow the mixture to boil for 7
 minutes more. Transfer the soup to bowls and add a dash of cayenne
 pepper, if desired, for some kick.

IMMUNE-BOOSTING SOUP
 Did you know onions are high in vitamin C? This might be why you crave
 them when you’re feeling run-down. This soup is incredibly immune
 boosting because it combines onion and tomato with garlic and spices. This
 recipe uses a combination of fresh herbs and dried spices. If you can go into
 the garden and pick them fresh, that is the ultimate for immune-boosting
 properties. If you do not have access to fresh herbs, you can just as easily
 make this recipe with dried herbs only.
 Make a large batch and keep it in your freezer, then just defrost in a pot
 and add some fresh herbs to freshen it up!
 Total time: 10 minutes
 Makes 2 servings
 INGREDIENTS:
 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
 1 small yellow onion
 8 fresh basil leaves or 1 teaspoon dried basil
 1 tablespoon fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme
 1 tablespoon fresh parsley or 1 teaspoon dried parsley
 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro or 1 teaspoon dried coriander
 3 fresh sage leaves or 1 teaspoon dried sage
 1 teaspoon cumin powder
 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
 1 teaspoon sea salt
 ½ teaspoon cracked black pepper
 Pinch or 2 of cayenne pepper
 1 tablespoon minced garlic
 3 medium juice tomatoes
 2 cups filtered water
Actions:
 1. Heat the oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Chop the onion and
 add it to the pot. Cook for 2 minutes until the onion begins to soften.
 Gather up all your herbs and spices.
 2. When the onion is soft, add the herbs, spices, and garlic and mix well.
 3. Squeeze the tomatoes into the pot. Chop up the tomato skins and add
 them to the pot as well.
 4. Add the water and let the soup cook for 7 minutes.
 5. Season with more sea salt and pepper, if desired. Top with broccoli
 sprouts and additional fresh herbs like basil, parsley, and cilantro, if
 desired.

ENERGY SOUP
 Ann Wigmore, an early proponent of raw food and blended soups taught a
 lot of her students to create an energy soup by blending vegetables and
 sprouts. She looked at soups as a complete meal. My variation of her soup
 follows her tradition. Ann said, “Let me share my vision with you: I see a
 world without sickness, sorrow or mental disturbance in which we are
 living in perfect balance with abundant health and harmony. Reconnect with
 nature and your body will take care of the rest. This is the beauty of self
healing.”1
 Ingredients:
 1 ½ cups coconut water or fermented probiotic beverage (kombucha or
 green tea kombucha)
 1 teaspoon dulse flakes
 1 to 2 apples, coarsely chopped
 1 cup baby spinach leaves
 1 green onion
 ¼ to ½ cup broccoli sprouts (or sunflower sprouts or alfalfa sprouts)
 1 avocado
 Actions:
 1. Blend all the ingredients in a high-powered blender until
 2. mixture is smooth.
 3. Serve the soup with fresh herbs like cilantro.
 Tips:
 Use a high-powered blender, such as a Vitamix, with a variable-speed
 dial, to prepare this recipe.
The soup can be an acquired taste. Tweak the ingredients and amounts
 to your liking. If you like savory seasonings, add cayenne, garlic, and
 sea salt to taste.
 The soup will keep for 7 to 10 days. Store in a glass, not plastic,
 container.

BASIC BONE BROTH
 Making bone broth is as simple as placing the bones from a grass-fed
 animal in a pot or slow cooker, and adding water and apple cider vinegar.
 The vinegar leaches the minerals out of the bones, which takes at least an
 hour. It is recommended to cook the bones longer, more like eight hours, to
 get the most minerals out of the bones.
 If you are pressed for time, you can add some bone broth powder (like
 Ancient Nutrition Bone Broth Protein Pure) to water and boil that for a
 superquick recipe.
 If bone broth doesn’t sound appealing to you, don’t force yourself to like
 it. Some people resonate with it and others don’t. Trust your body, and if
 you are curious or excited to try it, that is a strong indicator that it would be
 right for your body. The process for creating a bone broth is:
 1. Add bones to a crock pot or pot. Add filtered water to fully cover the
 bones.
 2. Add apple cider vinegar.
 3. Add vegetables and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. The
 skin from the bones will float to the top. Once the broth is cooked,
 discard.
VEGETABLE BROTH
 You can make your vegetable broth in double and triple batches and keep it
 in the fridge or in the freezer, so you always have it on hand for recipes.
 Total time: 10 minutes
 Makes 4 servings
 Ingredients:
 4 cups filtered water
 1 tablespoon onion powder
 1 tablespoon garlic powder
 1 tablespoon celery powder
 1 tablespoon coriander powder
 1 tablespoon fresh parsley
 1 tablespoon fresh thyme
 2 bay leaves
 1 teaspoon sea salt
 ¼ teaspoon black pepper
 Actions:
 1. Place all the ingredients in a large pot over high heat and bring to a
 boil. Allow to boil for 8 minutes.
 2. When cooled, transfer the broth to an airtight jar or container and store
 in the fridge or freezer. Unlike a bone broth, vegetable broth will store
 in the fridge for up to 14 days.

CHICKEN BONE BROTH
 When making bone broth, you’re allowing the collagen to leak out of the
 bones and form an incredibly nutrient-rich broth that is an anti
inflammatory, helps heal leaky gut, and helps to clear chemo brain.
 Total time: 30 minutes prep, 24 hours cooking
 Makes 9 cups
 Ingredients:
 Bones from 2 chickens (approx. 2 ½ pounds of chicken bones)
 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
 1 teaspoon sea salt
 1 teaspoon turmeric
 ½ teaspoon black pepper
 ½-inch piece of ginger root, peeled and chopped
 1 medium onion, peeled and quartered
 ½ head of broccoli, chopped into chunks
 2 celery stalks, cut into thirds
 2 carrots, peeled and halved
 2 garlic cloves, smashed
 1 bay leaf
 2 rosemary sprigs
 1 tablespoon dried oregano or oregano essential oil
 20 cups filtered water
 Actions:
 1. Add all ingredients to a large pot and bring to a boil. Once the liquid is
 boiling vigorously, lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 24 hours.
 2. Check the broth every few hours and stir.
3. You will know it’s cooked when you poke the bones with a fork and
 they fall apart and break. When cooked, strain the broth through mesh
 so you are left with just the liquid. Discard the solids.
 Tips:
 You can also put the ingredients into a slow cooker and let the broth
 cook for 8 to 12 hours.
 Some people like to roast their chicken bones before boiling them for a
 smoky flavor. You can also buy two organic rotisserie chickens instead
 of roasting your own.
 If you store chicken broth in the fridge, it will set hard, which is a good
 sign that the marrow nutrients came out of the bones. It will go to
 liquid again once heated.
 Store in the fridge for up to 6 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months.
 If freezing, just allow extra room in the container or jar as it will
 expand when frozen.
 Variation:
 Use beef bones for Beef Bone Broth.

CHAPTER 16
 STRENGTH-BUILDING MEALS
 FOR FISH AND MEAT EATERS
 Whether or not you choose to have fish and meat in your healing protocol is
 entirely up to you. Go deep within and ask yourself if it feels right to have
 animal protein in your diet, or not. And if so, how much? For me, it felt
 right to include fish or meat around every third day or a few times a week.
 For others, especially those with blood type O, they tend to feel better if
 they eat meat once a day. Others thrive on being vegetarian and vegan. It
 really is a personal choice, and no one should pressure you into eating meat
 or giving up meat if it doesn’t feel right for you.
 This chapter features recipes for people who want to include fish and
 meat in their diet, or who have been advised they need it in their healing
 regimen. Just make sure your meat always comes from a good source, a
 farm you trust or that is grass-fed and organic. I interviewed patients who
 did only vegan and then some who incorporated some meat during their
 healing period and that worked for them.
 The indigenous people also want us to know that when they killed an
 animal, they did it with intention—an intention to nourish and strengthen
 their bodies. They thanked the animal for its sacrifice. I believe they hunted
 in an incredibly admirable and sustainable way that worked well to support
 their health and the environment. Then grateful, they would enjoy the meat
 and let its nutrients seep into their muscles over the next few days, really
 allowing that protein to work in their body. Once they felt like they had
 used it all up, they would prepare to go and hunt again.
If we could adapt a similar philosophy in our modern society today, we
 would all eat meat only when we really need to, as well as get the most out
 of the spirit of the animal and the protein it provided.
 If you are healing cancer, this is the best type of meat that can go through
 your body:
 Organic
 Grass-fed
 Non-GMO
 Local from a farm you trust
 Wild-caught

 Quick and easy sides and snacks can be incredibly useful, especially if you
 have cancer that is making you lack energy or motivation. If you always
 have some healthy, nourishing, delicious snacks on standby it may just
 uplift your mood right away knowing they are there.
 A snack or a side dish can also become a meal! Enjoy the following
 recipes.
CANCER’S GONE CRACKERS
 Total time: 20 minutes to assemble, 12 hours to set in refrigerator, and 15 to
 20 hours to dehydrate
 Makes 20 servings (4 crackers each)
 Ingredients:
 3 cups ground flaxseeds
 1 cup sunflower seeds
 2 tablespoons minced onion or 3 tablespoons onion powder
 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
 1 tablespoon minced garlic or 2 tablespoons garlic powder
 2 teaspoons cumin powder
 1 teaspoon chili powder
 1 teaspoon sea salt
 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 ½ teaspoon turmeric
 ½ cup filtered water
 Actions:
 1. Put all the dry ingredients in the bowl of a food processor and blend
 until a fine, flourlike consistency is achieved.
 2. Add the water and mix until a batter forms. Cover and allow the batter
 to set in the fridge for 12 hours.
 3. Spread a ⅛-inch layer of batter on nonstick dehydrator sheets and
 dehydrate at 100°F for 15 to 20 hours. (Use a dehydrator kitchen
 appliance, or for an oven alternative see Tips below.)
 4. Cut or break the cracker sheet into pieces the size of your choice and
 store in an airtight container at room temperature or in the fridge for up

Tips:
 For an oven alternative to using a dehydrator, spread a layer of batter
 on nonstick baking paper or a baking sheet lightly greased with
 coconut oil and place in the oven at 180°F for 2 to 4 hours. The batter
 becomes a base when it is crisp and dry; check frequently. Cut into
 cracker squares.
 Serve these crackers with Hummus, Tahini, Pesto Sauce, and/or
 Cashew Cheese.
 This can be the base of the Raw Pizza as well as Raw Tacos.

 This is an incredibly easy recipe, and it’s delicious, packed with flavor and
 nutrition including iron, vitamin E, and fiber. You could also stuff each
 olive with half of a roasted garlic clove. Make sure to always buy organic
 olives, as regular olives are loaded with preservatives such as sodium
 benzoate and sulfites. If you buy already stuffed olives, they can contain
 sodium alginate, which is also a lethal preservative.

FERMENTED VEGETABLES
 This food-preserving technique, which has been used for hundreds of years,
 has many health benefits. Fermented vegetables are a natural probiotic!
 They can also boost immunity. You can eat them on their own or add them
 to soups, salads, and main dishes. You can make all types of blends using
 ingredients like cabbage, beets, cauliflower, cucumbers, carrots, peppers,
 and onions. One of the most famous fermented dishes is sauerkraut, which
 is fermented cabbage.
 The process of fermenting a vegetable is:
 1. Chop the vegetables into tiny pieces, which allows their liquids to
 release faster.
 2. Mix the vegetables with sea salt and herbs like thyme and oregano in a
 bowl.
 3. Add water and then transfer the vegetables to a jar. The water should
 cover the vegetables by at least ½ inch.
 4. Keep at room temperature for 3 to 5 days, and then in the refrigerator
 indefinitely. This is surprising, but fermented vegetables truly do last
 for years.
PROBIOTIC PICKLED CUCUMBERS
 Total time: 5 minutes preparation and 3–5 days fermenting
 Serves 5

 1. Place 5 whole cucumbers in a quart-size jar. Add the remaining
 ingredients. The water should cover the cucumbers completely, and the
 top of the liquid should be at least ½ inch below the top of the jar.
 2. Cover tightly and store at room temperature for 3 to 5 days before
 refrigerating. The pickles will keep indefinitely.
 3. Serve with salads and meat meals, or mix into stir-fries!

CASHEW CHEESE
 Serve on Raw Tacos, in Raw Lasagna, or on lettuce for Lettuce Wraps.
 Total time: 10 minutes
 Makes 1 serving (¼ cup each)
 Ingredients:
 2 cups cashews
 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
 Juice of 1 small lemon (but no more than ¼ cup)
 ½ teaspoon sea salt
 ½ cup filtered water (more for a softer cheese)
 Actions:
 1. Put all the ingredients in a food processor.
 2. Blend until the mixture is smooth, adding more water if a softer cheese
 is desired.
 Tips:
 Soak the cashews for 4 hours for a smoother, creamier cheese.
 For a nut-free version, use hempseeds, pumpkin seeds, or sunflower
 seeds instead of cashews.
 This recipe also works well with almonds, macadamia nuts, walnuts,
 or Brazil nuts.
 For a cheesier flavor, add more nutritional yeast, to taste. You can also
 make this recipe without nutritional yeast.
 Add a dash of cayenne pepper or chili flakes for spice.
 Add 1 teaspoon thyme for more flavor.
Variations:
 To make Raw “Parmesan” Cheese, add additional 3 tablespoons
 nutritional yeast to the mixture and spread to ¼-inch thick on a
 dehydrator tray. Place in a food dehydrator for 12 hours. It will
 crumble easily when you’re ready to use it.

HARD VEGAN CHEESE
 This recipe can make eliminating dairy cheese from your diet much easier!
 It sets hard, like regular cheese, and comforts you during the cheese craving
 time. To make the cheese set hard, an ingredient called agar is used. This is
 a naturally gelatinous substance obtained from seaweed.
 Total time: Overnight soaking, 15 minutes prep, 1 hour in fridge
 Serves 4
 Ingredients:
 ¾ cup cashews
 1 ½ teaspoon agar powder
 1 cup filtered water, divided
 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
 1 garlic clove
 1 ½ teaspoons arrowroot flour or tapioca flour
 ⅛ teaspoon sea salt
 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon lemon juice
 ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
 Actions:
 1. Soak the cashews in filtered water overnight.
 2. Mix the agar with ½ cup of filtered water in a saucepan. Do not apply
 heat yet; set aside.
 3. Drain the cashews, then add them to a food processer with the
 nutritional yeast, garlic, arrowroot, sea salt, lemon juice, turmeric, and
 the remaining ½ cup of filtered water. Blend until the mixture is very
 smooth.
 4. Add the cashew cheese to the agar pot and bring to a boil over low
 heat until it forms a thick batter consistency.
5. Transfer the mixture to a dish that you want the shape of your cheese
 to be in. You could divide it into cupcake holders, for example.
 Refrigerate the cheese for 1 hour and then enjoy.

BAKED KALE CHIPS
 Purchasing prewashed and precut kale will save you a lot of time. Simply
 season the kale and bake it in the oven.
 Total time: 10 minutes
 Makes 2 servings
 Ingredients:
 1 packet or bunch of prewashed, precut kale
 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
 1 teaspoon sea salt
 Actions:
 1. Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
 Lining with paper instead of oil will ensure faster bake time.
 2. Add the kale to a bowl along with the oil and sea salt and massage
 until the leaves are well covered.
 3. Bake for 9 minutes or until the edges of the kale are brown and crisp.
 They will dry out given time to rest after baking. Store in a dry place if
 you don’t eat them all at once!
 Tips:
 If you begin with a bunch of whole kale, wash it and drain the water
 well. You don’t want the kale to be wet when baking, which will result
 in soggy chips. Use a paper towel to take out the excess water. Tear the
 leaves from the stems in as big pieces as possible, keeping in mind the
 chips shrink as they bake. Discard the stems.
 Add cayenne pepper if you like them spicy!
 Add ⅓ cup nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor.

FRESH FERMENTED SALSA
 This salsa by Donna Schwenk, author of Cultured Food Life, is loaded with
 health-promoting properties, not to mention lots of prebiotics (fertilizer for
 your good bacteria) in the onions and garlic. Tomatoes are loaded with
 lycopene, and garlic and onions contain organosulfur and allicin, which
 bring cardiovascular benefits, inflammation reduction, and cancer
 protection. Donna says: “The probiotics in your gut can help you greatly if
 you have cancer or have to undertake chemotherapy. Chemo can destroy the
 gut lining, but inside the human gut, a layer of epithelial cells is regenerated
 every four to five days, as long as you have the right gut flora. If you have
 healthy gut flora and include a group of healthy strains of bacteria, your
 body will regenerate itself. If it is not healthy, then it slows or halts the
 regeneration of your intestinal cells. The probiotics in your gut can help
 determine how well your body handles chemotherapy—making it even
 more crucial for those with cancer and going through chemo to add
 probiotics and prebiotics to their diet.”1
 Total time:
 Makes 16 servings
 Ingredients:
 6 large ripe tomatoes
 2 small onions
 2 small red or green peppers
 Two 4-ounce cans organic chopped green chilies with juice
 2 garlic cloves

 1 tablespoon coconut sugar or honey (The microbes will eat the sugar and
 make more probiotics.)
⅛ teaspoon Cutting Edge Starter Culture (You can find this culture on
 Amazon or at culturedfoodlife.com.)

CHAPTER 19
 NUTRIENT-RICH DESSERTS AND
 SWEET SNACKS
CLASSIC THREE-INGREDIENT CHOCOLATE BALLS
 This recipe is made with just three ingredients, so it will be easy for you to
 remember how to make it for the rest of your life. Making healthy chocolate
 is easier than you may think. This is one of the most popular recipes I offer.
 This chocolate can stay fresh in the fridge for 14 days and in the freezer for
 three months. I also love to add almond butter or peanut butter to these balls
 for another flavor. And you can roll them in any superfood you like—for
 example, coconut or goji berries. These make beautiful-looking truffles,
 excellent gifts to give others too! And you can shape the chocolate mixture
 into balls or pat them into squares to make brownies.
 Total time: 10 minutes
 Makes 12 balls
 Ingredients:
 1 cup almond flour/nut meal (finely ground almonds or other nuts)
 ¼ cup cacao powder
 3 tablespoons maple syrup or raw honey
 Actions:
 1. Mix the nut meal, cacao powder, and maple syrup in a bowl.
 2. Roll the mixture into 12 balls.
 Tips:
 Add ¼ teaspoon sea salt and ¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract for
 enhanced flavor.
 Add essential oils (therapeutic-grade only): cinnamon, orange,
 peppermint, tangerine—start with 1 drop and then increase to 2 to 3
 drops according to your preference.
You can use this mixture to make brownies (just form the mixture into
 squares) or a dessert pie (simply press into a pie plate with your
 fingertips).
 Roll them in superfoods including shredded coconut, goji berries,
 hemp seeds, or cacao nibs.
 Variations:
 Add ¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract for Chocolate-Vanilla Balls.
 Add ¼ teaspoon sea salt for Salty Chocolate Balls.
 Add 1 to 2 tablespoons almond butter or peanut butter.
 Add a dash of chlorella or spirulina powder to make Alkaline
 Chocolate Balls.
 Add a dash of turmeric to make Turmeric Chocolate Balls.

RAW CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE DOUGH
 This cookie dough doesn’t need eggs or butter to make it delicious. It’s
 unbelievably buttery, made with almond flour and coconut oil. You can also
 bake these cookies for a Melt-In-Your Mouth Chocolate Chip experience.
 Total time: 10 minutes
 Makes 12 balls
 Ingredients:
 2 cups almond meal/flour (or tigernut flour)
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
 5 teaspoons maple syrup
 ¼ teaspoon sea salt
 1 tablespoon coconut oil
 2 tablespoons organic chocolate chips or cacao nibs
 Actions:
 1. Combine all the ingredients, except for the chocolate chips, in a large
 bowl and mix until well combined. The dough should be moist, so add
 a dash of water if needed.
 2. Stir the chocolate chips into the dough.
 3. Roll the dough into 12 balls, then press them into cookie shapes.
 They’re ready to eat!
 Tips:
 Roll the dough balls in cacao powder.
 Use tigernut flour if you have a nut allergy or want to go nut-free.

Bake in the oven at 325ºF for 8 minutes.
 Variations:

 for decoration and texture.
Keep these in the freezer or fridge and they’ll set harder.
 If you have a metal cupcake tray, it can help to hold the cupcakes

CHOCOLATE-AVOCADO MOUSSE
 I recommend using a powerful blender for this recipe, to whip it up so it has
 the same texture as traditional mousse. When it’s whipped like this, it’s
 super smooth with no chunks, the avocado is unrecognizable, and it’s
 unbelievably creamy and delicious.
 Total time: 5 minutes

 Ingredients:
 1. avocado
 2. tablespoons cacao powder, or more to taste

 honey if you want a sweeter mousse.
 Tips:
 Serve this mousse with fresh raspberries or strawberries.

CHOCOLATE SAUCE
 This sauce is a true game changer! It’s so creamy, smooth and thick, it’s
 ideal as a dip for strawberries and other fruits. Chocolate Sauce also makes
 a great topping for Plant-Based Ice Cream, Classic Three-Ingredient
 Chocolate Balls, and even the Raw Cookie Dough.
 Total time: 5 minutes
 Makes six ¼-cup servings
 Ingredients:
 ⅔ cup cacao powder
 ½ cup maple syrup
 ¼ cup extra-virgin coconut oil

 If you want the recipe to be raw, substitute raw honey for the maple
 syrup.
 You can also make this without a blender. Use a bowl and a spoon.
 Add the chocolate sauce to the inside of raspberries for Stuffed
 Raspberries.
 Variations:
Add ¾ cup raspberries for Chocolate Raspberry Sauce.
 Add ¾ cup cherries for Chocolate Cherry Sauce.

 blender basin so you can use it again.

CHOCOLATE ALMOND BUTTER CUPS
 This is the recipe that helped me convert my chocolate-and-peanut-butter
 cravings to a much healthier one. Before I created this recipe I was eating
 the conventional version that we all know so well, the one with sugar, non
organic dairy and preservatives . . . a dangerous combination! When I first
 made these I was over the moon delighted—I could enjoy my favorite
 chocolate-nut combination but in a much healthier way, where I was
 actually getting antioxidants, vitamin E, and protein. Have your chocolate
 cup and eat it too!
 Total time: 35 minutes

 2. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the chocolate mixture into each baking cup,
 filling ⅓ of the way. Reserve the other ½ of the mixture for the top of
 the cups.
 3. Put the baking cups in the freezer for 5 minutes to set.
4. Remove the cups from the freezer and add 1 teaspoon peanut butter to
 each. Each cup should now be ⅔ full.

 baking cups.
 6. Place the cups in the freezer again and allow to set for 15 minutes.
 Tips:
 Use your favorite nut butter.

 This nondairy ice cream recipe is wonderful served with fresh fruit, nuts,
 and/or Chocolate Sauce.
 Total time: 15 minutes prep, 3 to 5 hours to freeze
 Makes 2 servings
 Ingredients:
 1 cup cashew nuts (substitute sunflower seeds or hemp seeds if you have
 nut allergies)
 ⅔ cup Almond Milk or filtered water
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
 4 tablespoons maple syrup
 ¼ teaspoon sea salt

 the mixture is as creamy and frothy as you can make it.
 2. Pour the mixture into a container. Allow the ice cream to set in the

WHIPPED COCONUT CREAM
 Enjoy this vegan, dairy-free alternative to whipped cream. It goes great on
 fruit salads, ice cream, yogurt parfaits, pies, French toast, mousse, and cake.
 Total time: 10 minutes
 Makes 1 cup
 Ingredients:
 One 14-ounce can coconut cream, chilled overnight
 Actions:
 1. Open the can carefully and scoop out the top layer of the hard coconut
 cream into a bowl with a hand mixer, or a blender. A powerful blender
 will work, but a hand mixer is better. Be careful not to get any liquids
 in the bowl at all; this will not allow the coconut cream to whip, it
 must be the hard part of the cream only.
 2. Whip for a few minutes until the coconut cream is soft and fluffy.
 Tips:
 Add a dash of vanilla extract to enhance the flavor.
 To properly chill the coconut cream, just leave it in the fridge
 overnight. The next day, don’t shake it; just open the can and scoop out
 the top layer, which should be very thick. You won’t need to use the
 runny liquid, so reserve it for another recipe, such as a curry!
 Chill your mixing bowl to help you get a nice consistency when
 beating.
 If you let the cream rest in the fridge, it will harden and set.

GELATO
 You can’t get any simpler than this ice cream made with just one ingredient:
 frozen bananas! And then add other ingredients to make other flavors.
 Total time: 5 minutes
 Makes 1 to 2 servings
 Ingredients:
 2 frozen bananas
 Actions:
 Add the bananas to a blender and mix until they are smooth and fluffy,
 exactly like ice cream. At first your gelato will appear chunky and then it
 will become juicy and smooth.
 Tips:
 To freeze bananas, peel them and then wrap them in plastic and put in
 the freezer. Grab however many you need whenever you want to make
 a smoothie or ice cream.
 Add other ingredients for different flavors. For example, a dash of
 vanilla, a vanilla bean, 2 teaspoons cacao powder, 1 tablespoon peanut
 butter, almond butter, or ⅓ cup strawberries, raspberries, or
 blueberries.
 Variations:
 Add ½ cup frozen blueberries for Blueberry Gelato.
 Add 2 teaspoons cacao powder for Chocolate Gelato.
 Add 3 frozen strawberries for Strawberry Gelato.

FRUIT LEATHERS
 Satisfy your candy cravings and feel fulfilled as a cook in the process by
 making homemade Fruit Leathers. Basically, to make one you simply puree
 your favorite fruits and flavors and then dehydrate them in flat sheets until
 they are sticky and sweet like candy. Note: Although these take less than 10
 minutes to prepare, they need to be dehydrated overnight. It is also possible
 to use your oven if it’s set on very low (150ºF) heat.
 I put this recipe in the book for candy lovers! If you squish the leather
 together or make a roll-up with it, this can fulfill gummy bear cravings. The
 Cherry Leather is my favorite fruit leather!
 Actions:
 1. Add your fruit ingredients to a food processor and blend until smooth
 with no chunks.
 2. Place parchment paper on the mesh screens in your dehydrator. Pour
 the fruit mixture on the paper to ¼-inch thick.
 3. Dehydrate at 115ºF for 8 to 12 hours, or until no longer wet.
 Tip:
 Instead of a dehydrator, bake in your oven at 150ºF for 4 to 6 hours.

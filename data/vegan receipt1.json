Chef Linda: Best is a term reserved for things of the highest quality and excellence. It is not to be
taken lightly, which is exactly why we use it to describe our banana bread. Conjure up the cozy scent
of cinnamon and banana. Close your eyes and imagine biting into a thick, warm piece of bread that’s
moist, not too sweet, gently spiced, and studded with nuts and chocolate chips. Our banana bread is a
regular on the breakfast menu at The Homestead; now, make it a regular in your home.
Allergens: Contains gluten, nuts, and ingredients that may contain soy
Tip: Use heavily-speckled, brown bananas for the most banana flavor. Set aside a few
to ripen up just for this recipe.
Ingredients
1 cup whole wheat flour
½ cup almond flour or almond meal (or ¾ cup raw almonds, finely ground)
½ cup old-fashioned oats
¼ cup ground flaxseed
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp baking powder
½ tsp baking soda
½ tsp salt
3 very ripe bananas, peeled
¼ cup unrefined coconut oil, melted, plus more for the pan (or your favorite oil)
½ cup maple syrup, room temperature
¼ cup unsweetened applesauce, room temperature
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp fresh lemon juice
½ cup chopped walnuts
½ cup vegan chocolate chips or blueberries (optional)

Directions
Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly oil a 9- by-5-inch loaf pan.
In a large bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, almond flour,
oats, flaxseed, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
In a medium bowl, mash bananas very well with a fork. Add in melted
coconut oil, maple syrup, applesauce, vanilla, and lemon juice.
Alternatively, blend bananas and wet ingredients together in a food
processor for a smoother result. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry
ingredients and mix gently. Gently stir in nuts and chocolate chips. Be
careful not to overmix as you will create a tough, not tender, bread.
Pour the batter into prepared pan and bake for 50 to 55 minutes.
You’ll start to really smell the bread when it is close to being done.
Bread is done when the edges are nicely browned, the bread is just
firm to the touch, and a toothpick or knife inserted into the middle
comes out clean. Cool for about 20 minutes. Insert a knife along the
edge of the pan and invert onto a cutting board or plate. Let cool
another 10 minutes before cutting, or gently slice while warm.

MAKES 16 (2-INCH) SQUARES
Chef Linda: Delightful and delicious—a little sweet, a little salty—these easy breakfast bars feel
like a treat no matter what time of day you enjoy them. In just one bite, you’ll taste crunchy nuts,
sweet and chewy dried fruit, and just enough chocolate chips to make you wonder if you should be
eating these for breakfast or dessert! These breakfast bars have graced the table of our board
meetings, Homestead breakfasts, and staff lunches. Any morning that starts with one of these is
bound to be a good one.
Allergens: Contains nuts and ingredients that may contain soy
Special Equipment: Food processor
Ingredients
1 cup raw cashews
¾ cup vegan chocolate chips
½ cup raw walnuts
½ cup hemp seeds
½ cup unsweetened, shredded coconut
½ tsp coarse salt
1½ cups pitted, chopped dates (about 11–13 dates)
½ cup dried cranberries
2 Tbsps raw or roasted unsalted almond butter
1 Tbsp melted coconut oil
Directions
Place the cashews, chocolate chips, walnuts, hemp seeds, coconut,
and salt in a food processor. Pulse until nuts and chocolate chips are
ground to a medium texture. You want very small pieces, but not the
consistency of nut flour. Empty the mixture into a bowl and set aside.
2.
3.
Place dates, cranberries, almond butter, and coconut oil in the food
processor and process until the dates and cranberries are broken down
and everything is combined, but it still has a bit of texture. Add the
nuts back into the processor and pulse a few times to combine.
Mixture should be moist enough to hold together when pinched.
Line an 8-inch square baking pan or casserole with parchment,
allowing two ends to hang over the sides of the pan slightly so you
can lift the contents out after chilling. Empty contents of food
processor into the lined baking pan and firmly press down. Chill in the
refrigerator for about 1 hour. Remove from refrigerator, carefully lift
out parchment paper, and cut into squares. Serve chilled.

Chef Linda: There you are on a lazy Saturday morning, sitting curbside at an intimate French café .
Nearby, steam swirls upward from rich mahogany coffee. A sweet scent ignites your appetite as you
wait with anticipation for a forkful of decadent French toast. Wait—France is not in your future, you
say? Then let this buttery, praline-adorned breakfast delight take you there. Without relying on
unkind standbys like eggs, cream, and butter, this French toast casserole, a Homestead specialty, gets
its luscious custard filling from bananas and nondairy milk. A lovely addition to special brunches and
holiday mornings, this simple dish will pamper your spirit.
Allergens: Contains gluten, nuts, and ingredients that may contain soy
Make Ahead: Bake and cool the dish 1 or 2 days in advance, then cover with foil and
refrigerate overnight. Reheat in the oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes while the
coffee is brewing.
Ingredients
Praline Topping
¼ cup vegan butter
1 cup brown sugar, packed
½ cup maple syrup
1 cup finely chopped pecans
French Toast
1 large (14- to 16-ounce) French baguette, cut into ½-inch thick slices
2 large, ripe bananas, peeled and sliced into ¼-inch thick rounds
2 cups fresh or frozen and thawed blueberries
2 cups unsweetened nondairy milk (if using sweetened, reduce maple syrup by 1–2 tsps)
½ cup maple syrup
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
1 Tbsp vanilla extract
1 tsp ground cinnamon
Directions
Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil a 9-inch square casserole dish.
To make the praline topping, melt the butter in a small pot over
medium heat. Add brown sugar and syrup. Stir and bring to a simmer.
Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until
the sugar is dissolved. Stir in the pecans and turn off the heat. Leave
the pot on the stove to keep warm or else the mixture will harden. If
the praline mixture hardens, reheat for a few minutes, stirring
occasionally.
To assemble the French toast casserole, arrange one layer of baguette
slices on the bottom of the casserole dish. Top the bread with a single
layer of banana slices. Sprinkle half of the blueberries over the
bananas and drop spoonfuls of the praline topping over the
blueberries, using about half of it. Add another layer of bread and
bananas, and top with remaining blueberries. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, syrup, vanilla, and cinnamon.
Pour over the bread in the casserole, saturating the top pieces. Spoon
on the remaining half of the praline topping.
Cover the dish with foil and place on a baking tray. Bake for 35 to 40
minutes. Remove the foil for the last 10 minutes of baking. There
should be liquid bubbling around the sides and corners when it’s done.
Remove from the oven and let sit for a few minutes before serving.

The Homestead, our Pecan Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake has been rousing sleepy guests for years.
Some equip themselves with forks and others with bare hands, but all of them end up wiping crumbs
and traces of melted chocolate from their satisfied smiles. Tender, moist, vanilla cake, liberally
studded with chocolate chips and topped with a nutty, sweet crumble, it’s a cake you’ll covet—but
please consider sharing with friends and family.

MAKES ABOUT 4 CUPS
Chef Linda: Making homemade granola is like casting a cozy, cinnamon-and-vanilla-scented spell.
People will wander into your kitchen, asking, “What’s that smell?” A glorious assortment of oats,
nuts, seeds, and a touch of sweetness will make this granola a healthy and delicious household staple.
A beloved breakfast favorite at The Homestead, our granola is heaped into bowls and splashed with
freshly made vanilla cashew cream. This recipe is forgiving and made for substitutions, so feel free to
mix and match nuts and seeds to suit your tastes.
Allergens: Contains nuts
Special Equipment: Blender, for the vanilla cashew cream
Tip: Substitute the same quantity of seeds for a nut-free version.
Ingredients
Granola
½ cup maple syrup
½ cup olive oil (or your favorite oil)
2 tsps vanilla
3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
½ cup raw nuts of your choice, like almonds, walnuts, or cashews
½ cup raw seeds of your choice, like pumpkin, sunflower, or hemp
¼ cup shredded, unsweetened coconut
2 tsps ground cinnamon
½ tsp salt
1 cup dried fruit, like cranberries, cherries, or raisins
Vanilla Cashew Cream
1 cup raw cashews, soaked for 15–30 minutes, drained
1.
2.
3.
4.
3 cups water, plus more to thin if necessary
4–6 pitted dates (or 2 Tbsps maple syrup), increase for more sweetness
2 tsps vanilla extract
½ tsp ground cinnamon (optional)
Pinch of salt
Toppings (Optional)
Chopped apples, pears, bananas, or seasonal berries
Directions
Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a rimmed baking tray with parchment.
Using a rimmed tray will prevent granola from spilling when you stir
it.
In a large bowl, whisk together the maple syrup, oil, and vanilla. Stir
in the oats, nuts, seeds, coconut, cinnamon, and salt.
Pour the granola onto the prepared baking tray. Bake for about 15
minutes. Remove tray from the oven and stir to ensure all granola gets
toasted. Return to the oven and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, or
until lightly browned and fragrant. Watch carefully so as not to burn.
Remove tray from oven and let cool slightly, then mix in the dried
fruit. Serve with vanilla cashew cream or store in sealed plastic bag or
container.
To make the vanilla cashew cream, place all the ingredients in a
blender and blend on high speed for 1 minute. Cashew cream should
be completely smooth and have the consistency of thick milk; you
should be able to pour and drink it. Serve immediately or pour into
mason jars and chill in the refrigerator before serving. The cream will
keep for three to four days. Cashew cream will separate as it sits, so
shake well before each use.

MAKES 8 (4-INCH) GRIDDLE CAKES
Chef Linda: If ever there was a reason to spring from your bed in the morning and greet the day with
delight, these griddle cakes are it. Delicate and crispy on the outside, creamy and bursting with tartsweet blueberries on the inside, these little beauties come together in a flash and are eaten just as
quickly. You’ll need quick-cooking instant polenta here, not the regular kind, so that the result is
tender, not gritty. Pine nuts are buttery and soft and add just the right texture. And as if these weren’t
good enough on their own, a lovely lemon-butter syrup adds a salty-sweetness in each mouthful. One
person can easily gobble up most of these, so you might need to make more than you planned!
Allergens: Contains gluten, nuts, and ingredients that may contain soy
Ingredients
Griddle Cakes
1¼ cup unsweetened nondairy milk
2 Tbsps olive oil, plus more for frying
1 Tbsp lemon zest, from 2 large lemons
½ tsp vanilla extract
¾ cup instant polenta
½ cup all-purpose flour
¼ cup almond meal
2 Tbsps granulated sugar
2 tsps baking powder
½ tsp salt
½ cup fresh blueberries (or frozen and thawed)
⅓ cup pine nuts
Lemon-Butter Syrup
1.
2.
3.
4.
⅓ cup maple syrup
2 Tbsps vegan butter
¼ tsp vanilla extract
¼ tsp lemon extract
Directions
To make the griddle cakes, start by heating the milk in a small pot just
until it simmers. Remove from heat and add in oil, lemon zest, and
vanilla.
Mix together the polenta, flour, almond meal, sugar, baking powder,
and salt in a large bowl. Pour the warmed milk into the polenta
mixture and stir to combine. Fold in the blueberries and pine nuts. Let
the mixture sit for a few minutes so that the polenta softens and
absorbs the liquid. Rinse out the pot.
To make the lemon-butter syrup, heat the syrup and butter in the pot
until the butter melts. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and
lemon extract.
Heat about 1 teaspoon of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Use a ¼
cup measure or large spoon to spoon the batter onto the hot pan.
(Pancakes should measure 3½ to 4 inches.) Cook until the bottoms are
golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook for another 3 minutes
until bottoms are golden brown. Serve immediately with the warm
syrup.
Spice Zucchin Carr Brea
MAKES 1 LOAF, ABOUT 8 TO 10 SLICES
Chef Linda: Even a summer blight would not deny the zucchini its inalienable right to multiply and
barge out of the garden in search of the spotlight: subtlety and humility are not its strongest virtues.
To tame it is to strip it of its most notable attribute: abundance. A friendlier approach yields one of
the season’s most comforting treats—zucchini bread. This midsummer headliner has no use for eggs
or dairy, demonstrating how liberating a compassionate approach to baking can be. Hearty and
humble, speckled with shredded carrots, studded with nuts, and moistened with applesauce, this
bread is heady with warming spices. Sadly, summer’s bounty will leave no trace in the garden when
the seasons change, but an extra loaf of this zucchini carrot bread, tucked away in the freezer, serves
as a delightful reminder on winter’s darkest days.
Allergens: Contains gluten and nuts
Special Equipment: Food processor or box grater
Tip: Serve with a “schmear” of artisan vegan cream cheese for a real treat.
Ingredients
1½ cups whole wheat flour
½ cup old-fashioned oats
2 tsps baking powder
2 tsps ground cinnamon
1 tsp salt
1 tsp ground allspice
1 tsp baking soda
1 medium zucchini, grated, about 1 cup packed
2 large carrots, peeled and grated, about 1 cup
½ cup maple syrup
⅓ cup apple or orange juice
¼ cup unsweetened applesauce
2 Tbsps oil
2 tsps vanilla extract
1.
2.
3.
4.
2 tsps fresh lemon juice
½ cup chopped walnuts or pecans
Directions
Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly oil a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. In a large
bowl, combine flour, oats, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, allspice,
and baking soda.
Squeeze excess moisture from zucchini and carrots with your hands or
wring them out in a clean dish towel. Add zucchini and carrots to the
bowl with the dry ingredients. Toss to combine, coating them with
flour and breaking up any clumps.
In a small bowl, combine the syrup, juice, applesauce, oil, vanilla, and
lemon juice. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry
ingredients. Gently mix until ingredients are almost completely
incorporated. Gently stir in nuts.
Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes.
The bread is ready when the top is golden brown, the sides have
begun to pull away from the loaf pan, it’s just firm to the touch, and
an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Leave to cool in the pan for 20
minutes. Slide a knife around the edges and invert on a cutting board
or plate to remove the bread. Let cool another 5 to 10 minutes before
slicing and serving.
Simpl, Swee Choclat Chi Scone
MAKES 8 SCONES
Chef Linda: Who doesn’t love a nice scone? Whether sweet or savory, this lovely treat is crispy on
the outside while delicate and light on the inside. Some say scones originated in Scotland; others
believe England’s fashionable habit of high tea included these biscuit-like cakes from the outset.
Then there’s the Irish who call dibs on the original scone. Scones needn’t instigate another war of the
three kingdoms; the kitchen is neutral territory for making these simple treats. Chocolate chips are an
indulgent add-in, but try your own favorites, such as dried cranberries and pistachios, currants and
walnuts, or sun-dried tomatoes and chives (omit the sugar for this savory version). These scones
should be savored slowly and lovingly on a lazy Saturday morning—in your pajamas, of course.
Allergens: Contains gluten and ingredients that may contain soy
Tip: Replace chocolate chips with add-ins like dried cranberries and pistachios,
currants and walnuts, or sun-dried tomatoes and chives (omit sugar for this savory
version).
Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 Tbsps granulated sugar
1 Tbsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
¼ cup refined coconut oil
1 cup vegan chocolate chips
¾ cup + 2 Tbsps nondairy milk, plus more for brushing scones
Coarse sugar for finishing
To Serve
Vegan butter
Jam
Coconut Whipped Cream
1.
2.
3.
Directions
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Mix
together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing
bowl. Using your fingers, work the coconut oil into the dry
ingredients until the particles are the size of small peas. Mix in the
chocolate chips. Add the milk and use your hands to gently mix until
the dough is slightly sticky and soft. Add a little more milk if
necessary. Don’t overwork the dough or scones will be tough, not
tender.
Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface and form it into an
8-inch circle. Cut the circle into 8 equal triangles with a floured knife
or use a biscuit cutter to cut out round scones. Re-roll scraps and
make as many scones as you can. Arrange scones on the prepared
baking tray, leaving 2 inches between each one. Brush with milk and
sprinkle the coarse sugar on top.
Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned.
Remove from the oven and serve the scones warm with vegan butter,
jam, or coconut whipped cream. You probably won’t have any to
store, but if you do, place extras in a sealed container or zip-top
plastic bag. Freshen them up by popping them into the oven for a few
minutes. Baked scones freeze well for up to three months.
Weeken Waf le wit Fudg Sauc
MAKES 4 BELGIAN-STYLE OR 8 REGULAR-SIZED WAFFLES
Chef Linda: Waffles shouldn’t come out of a box. They should come right off of a hot waffle iron to
be devoured with giddy delight. The subtle scent of homemade waffles can coax even the most
reluctant risers to the breakfast table. Without eggs and milk, this batter still holds together perfectly,
and the leavening power of baking powder helps the waffles rise to any occasion. They’re crisp on
the outside, tender on the inside, and full of nooks and crannies for all your favorite toppings—like
this decadent fudge sauce.
Allergens: Contains gluten and ingredients that may contain soy
Special Equipment: Waffle iron (Note: waffle irons vary greatly and will impact the
final product.)
Ingredients
Chocolate Fudge Sauce
½ cup canned regular coconut milk
¾ cup brown sugar, packed
½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
¼ tsp salt
1 Tbsp vegan butter
1 tsp vanilla extract
Waffles
2½ cups all-purpose flour
3 Tbsps granulated sugar
1 Tbsp baking powder
1 tsp ground cinnamon
¼ tsp salt
2 cups + 2 Tbsps unsweetened nondairy milk, plus more to thin if necessary
3 Tbsps oil
1.
2.
3.
4.
2 tsps vanilla extract
Other Toppings
Maple syrup
Vegan chocolate chips
Vegan butter and powdered sugar
Fresh fruit such as chopped apples, bananas, or berries
Directions
Preheat oven to 250°F to keep waffles warm, if desired.
To make the chocolate fudge sauce, whisk together the coconut milk,
brown sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium pot over medium
heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the brown sugar has dissolved,
about 6 minutes. Add the butter and stir to melt. Remove pot from
heat and stir in vanilla. Set aside to cool slightly before serving. Store
extra in a sealed container in the refrigerator and heat desired portion
in a microwave-safe bowl for 15 seconds to serve.
To make the waffles, mix together, in a medium bowl, the all-purpose
flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. In a small bowl,
whisk together the milk, oil, and vanilla. Pour the wet ingredients into
the dry ingredients and stir gently until a thick batter is formed. The
batter should be thick enough that you can scoop up a heaping
spoonful. If it’s too thick, add another 1 tablespoon of milk.
Read and follow manufacturer’s instructions for your waffle iron.
When the waffle iron is hot, spoon the batter so that the surface isn’t
entirely covered, allowing room for the batter to spread. Close the lid
and wait for the indicator to alert you that the waffle is done. Do not
open lid prematurely. Use a fork or toothpick to gently loosen the
waffle from the iron. Serve immediately, drizzled with chocolate
fudge sauce, or keep warm in the oven.

Chunk Monke Pancake
MAKES ABOUT 6 (4-INCH) PANCAKES
Chef Linda: Making pancakes is an act of love. Without thinking about it, we pour our affection and
nurturing energies into every spoonful of batter. Without eggs and milk, these pancakes are still
gloriously light and fluffy, with just enough crisp on the outside to bring tears to your eyes. While we
like the addition of banana, chocolate chips, and peanut butter syrup, you can omit them and simply
stack plain pancakes high on your plate and dress with a pat of (vegan) butter and maple syrup. The
simple pleasure of homemade pancakes will make you wonder why boxed was ever good enough . . .
and why you thought you needed eggs to make them!
Allergens: Contains gluten, peanuts, and ingredients that may contain soy
Tip: For a seasonal spin, add 1 tablespoon of canned pumpkin (reduce the milk by the
same amount) and add a bit of cinnamon. For added protein and texture, use ¼ cup
hemp seeds or cooked quinoa.
Ingredients
Peanut Butter Syrup
1 cup maple syrup
½ cup smooth, salted peanut butter
½ tsp vanilla extract
Pancakes
1¼ cup unsweetened nondairy milk
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
½ cup all-purpose flour
½ cup whole wheat flour
1 tsp baking powder
¼ tsp baking soda
¼ tsp salt
2 Tbsps maple syrup
1.
2.
3.
4.
1 Tbsp olive oil, plus more for cooking pancakes
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 large very ripe banana, chopped into small pieces, about 1 cup
½ cup vegan chocolate chips
Directions
To make the peanut butter syrup, mix the syrup and peanut butter
together in a small pot over medium heat until smooth, about 2
minutes. Remove from heat, add vanilla, and stir. Cover and set aside.
To make the pancakes, whisk together milk and apple cider vinegar in
a small bowl. Set aside while preparing the dry ingredients. In a
medium bowl, mix together the all-purpose and whole wheat flours,
baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir the syrup, oil, and vanilla
into the milk mixture and pour this into the bowl with dry ingredients.
Stir to combine, being careful not to overmix. Gently stir in the
banana.
Warm a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Add 1 teaspoon of oil
to the pan and carefully spread with a paper towel. Test the
temperature by cooking one small pancake first. If the batter sizzles
when it hits the pan and forms bubbles on the top after 1 to 2 minutes
without burning, your temperature is right. If it doesn’t sizzle, wait 1
or 2 minutes longer, or increase the heat slightly. If the batter burns
quickly, turn down the heat and wait for the pan to cool down.
Use a ¼ cup measure to create 4-inch pancakes. Pour batter onto the
pan and wait until bubbles form on the surface, 2 to 3 minutes.
Sprinkle on a few chocolate chips. Use a spatula to flip pancakes and
cook for another 1 or 2 minutes or until bottoms are lightly browned.
Continue until the batter is gone. To serve pancakes, top with warm
peanut butter syrup. Store extra syrup in a covered container for up to
1 week.
Tempe Ove Ha
SERVES 8 AS A SIDE DISH
Chef Linda: A common description of a “hash” generally involves two words you won’t find here—
meat and eggs. Instead, ground tempeh and a winning combination of fresh vegetables make for a
savory breakfast dish that is just as good. Hash is often made on the stovetop, but we roast ours, not
only to reduce the amount of oil used in frying, but also to deepen and lock in the flavors. Enjoy this
hash alone, as a side dish to our quiche (pg. 37) or Tofu Scramble (pg. 34), or stuffed and roasted in a
bell pepper or acorn squash.
Allergens: Contains soy and ingredients that may contain gluten
Special Equipment: Food processor or box grater
Tip: This hash loves a splash of hot sauce.
Ingredients
1 (8-ounce) package of tempeh
1¼ cup water
3 tsps tamari or soy sauce
½ pound waxy potatoes (Yukon Gold, red, or yellow), cut into ¼-inch cubes, about 2 cups
½ medium onion, finely chopped, about ½ cup
1 red or green bell pepper, chopped in ¼-inch pieces, about 1 cup
1 jalapeño pepper, minced (optional)
2 large cloves garlic, minced, about 2 tsps
2 Tbsps olive oil
1 Tbsp maple syrup
2 tsps paprika
1 tsp dried oregano
¼ tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
¾ tsp salt
Ground black pepper, to taste
1.
2.
Directions
Use a large-holed box grater or food processor to grate/grind tempeh.
Alternatively, use your hands to crumble the tempeh into very small
pieces. Place ground in a small pot with the water and tamari. Bring to
a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes, until the tempeh has
softened. Drain remaining liquid and transfer tempeh to a large bowl.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking trays with parchment. To the
bowl with the tempeh, add the potatoes, onion, bell pepper, jalapeño,
garlic, oil, syrup, paprika, oregano, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper.
Toss to combine. Empty contents of the bowl onto prepared baking
tray and spread evenly. Roast in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, stirring
occasionally. The hash is done when the vegetables are soft and
tempeh has browned nicely. Serve immediately.
Freeze-Friendl Breakfa Burrito
MAKES 8 BURRITOS
Chef Sara: These breakfast burritos are easy, hearty, and fun, packing a walloping 20 grams of
protein each, which will help you power through your busy mornings. They’re also economical. Not
a fan of tofu? Substitute crumbled tempeh. Need a soy-free option? Substitute crumbled seitan.

Tip: Make the spice blend in advance to save time—double the recipe to keep extra
on hand for spicing up a basic tofu scramble or roasted potatoes. It’s seriously
delicious!
Ingredients
Spice Blend
2 Tbsps nutritional yeast
1 Tbsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp salt
½ tsp dried oregano
½ tsp chili powder
½ tsp smoked paprika
½ tsp granulated garlic
Ground black pepper, to taste
Burritos
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 medium red onion, chopped in ¼-inch pieces, about 1 cup
1 large red bell pepper, chopped in ¼-inch pieces, about 1 cup
1 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed, excess water squeezed out
1 (14- to 16-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, rinsed and crumbled
1.
2.
3.
4.
2 (15-ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed
Hot sauce, to taste (optional)
8 large (approximately 10-inch) wraps or flour tortillas
Directions
To make the spice blend, mix together all the ingredients in a small
bowl.
To make the burritos, heat the olive oil in a large pan over mediumhigh heat. Add onion and bell pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally,
until the onions are softened and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add
spinach, tofu, and black beans. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring
frequently. Add the spice mix and stir. Add hot sauce, taste, and adjust
seasonings as necessary. Cool for 10 to 15 minutes before assembly to
keep your burritos from getting soggy.
Divide the mixture into 8 equal portions. Place filling on the bottom
third of a wrap and roll while tucking the ends in. Place seam-side
down on a cutting board or plate. To freeze, place all of the burritos
on a large plate, freeze until solid, and then place in a freezer bag or
wrap individually in plastic. The burritos will keep in the freezer for
three to six months. Store unused spice blend in a covered container.
To heat in the microwave: remove a burrito from the bag or plastic
wrap, place on a microwave-safe plate, and tent with a paper towel.
Microwave on high for 1 minute, flip the burrito, then microwave for
an additional 1 minute, until the burrito is heated through. To heat in
the oven: preheat the oven to 350°F. Remove a burrito from the bag or
plastic wrap, wrap in foil, and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until
heated through, turning over once during baking. Serve immediately.

Ultimat Tf Scrambl
SERVES 4
Chef Linda: If you’re discouraged at the thought of life without eggs, this recipe is for you! With the
right seasonings and add-ins, tofu can be transformed into a scrumptious, compassionate, and healthy
alternative to scrambled eggs, with all the comfort and promise of a hot, savory scramble to start the
day. Turmeric gives a sunny, yellow color to the tofu and sulphur-scented black salt lends the familiar
“eggy” taste: Tofu scrambles are also good for substitutions. Use black beans, avocado, and salsa if
you feel like wearing your sombrero to breakfast, or try spicy harissa, black olives, and peppers if the
Middle East is teasing your taste buds.
Allergens: Contains soy
Ingredients
2 Tbsps olive oil
½ medium onion, finely chopped, about a ½ cup
1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped in ¼-inch pieces, about 1 cup
½ cup sliced mushrooms
2 large cloves garlic, minced, about 2 tsps
1 tsp ground cumin
¾ tsp black salt (or regular salt)
½ tsp ground turmeric
1 (14- to 16-ounce) package of firm tofu, drained and rinsed
¼ cup nutritional yeast
Large handful of fresh, baby spinach, chopped, about 1 cup packed
1 medium avocado, pitted and diced
Ground black pepper, to taste
Directions
Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Cook onion, stirring
occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes until they start to soften and become

translucent. Add bell pepper, mushrooms, garlic, cumin, black salt,
and turmeric. Cook for another 8 to 10 minutes, or until vegetables are
tender.
Using your hands, crumble the tofu into the pan and stir. Stir in
nutritional yeast and spinach. Cook for another several minutes, or
until all the ingredients are combined, any excess liquid has cooked
off, and flavors have begun to mingle. Remove from heat, gently stir
in avocado, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve
immediately.

Avocad, Edamam, an Kal Tartine
MAKES 4 TARTINES
Chef Linda: Tartines are just a fancy way to say open-faced sandwiches—and the ingredients in this
recipe certainly call for a fancier name than avocado toast. If you’re looking for a way to rejuvenate
this popular breakfast, look no further. Fresh, curly kale gets a shower of bright lemon juice and is
combined with creamy avocado and tender edamame beans to meet in a verdant mashup. Sweet
seasonal fruit tops it all off to balance out the flavors. Enjoy this dish in the morning to start your day,
or in the evening to end it (alongside a bowl of Rustic Summer Gazpacho [pg. 67]).
Allergens: Contains soy
Special Equipment: Food processor (optional)
TIP: Turn this into a creative and colorful crostini for your next party by using toasted
baguette slices.
Ingredients
3 large kale leaves, stemmed and finely chopped, about 1 cup packed
2 tsps fresh lemon juice
2 tsps extra-virgin olive oil, divided
½ tsp coarse salt, divided
½ avocado, pitted
¼ cup frozen edamame cooked according to package instructions or thawed
4 slices hearty multigrain or gluten-free bread
½ cup chopped seasonal fruit, like strawberries, peaches, nectarines, apples, or pears
Directions
Place kale in a medium bowl and add lemon, olive oil, and ¼
teaspoon of the salt. Use your hands to massage for 1 or 2 minutes,
until the kale softens.
2.
3.
Scoop avocado flesh into the bowl of a food processor. Add edamame
and the remaining ¼ teaspoon of salt. Pulse several times to combine,
creating a chunky-smooth mixture. Alternatively, mash the avocado
and edamame in a bowl with a fork.
Toast the bread. Spread about 2 tablespoons of avocado-edamame
mash on each piece of toast. Top with kale mixture and 1 tablespoon
of chopped fruit. Serve immediately.
Spinac, Asparagu, an Sausag Quich
MAKES ONE (9-INCH DEEP-DISH QUICHE), 8 TO 12 SERVINGS
Chef Sara: Quiche has endured because of its great taste, festive appearance (it’s a savory breakfast
in a pie shell!), and chameleon-like ability to adapt to a variety of delicious seasonings. It can easily
be made vegan by substituting tofu and cashews for the eggs typically used in this dish, without
losing any of the familiar texture. This favorite quiche incarnation was inspired by a recipe by Isa
Chandra Moskowitz. It gets a seasonal springtime twist with spinach, asparagus, and vegan sausage.
Allergens: Contains gluten, nuts, and soy
Special Equipment: Food processor
Tip: Scoop extra filling into a lightly oiled ramekin and bake alongside the pie for about
15 to 20 minutes. To convert this to a vegan frittata, skip the pie crust and spread the
filling into an oiled 8-inch square baking dish and bake.
Ingredients
1 unbaked vegan pie crust (store-bought or homemade [pg. 209]), fitted into a 9-inch pie plate
Tofu-Cashew Custard
½ cup raw cashews, soaked in water for 4–8 hours, drained (or soaked sunflower seeds)
1 pound extra-firm tofu, drained and rinsed
2 Tbsps nutritional yeast
2 tsps Dijon or yellow mustard
½ tsp ground turmeric
1 Tbsp cornstarch or arrowroot
Vegetables
1 Tbsp olive oil
2 large shallots, finely chopped, about ½ cup
½ pound fresh asparagus, ends trimmed, thinly sliced
3 medium garlic cloves, minced, about 1 Tbsp
1 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, defrosted and water squeezed out
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
2 large vegan sausages, crumbled
2 tsps fresh thyme, leaves only, finely chopped (or 1 tsp dried thyme, crumbled)
1 tsp salt
Ground black pepper, to taste
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Use a fork to prick the unbaked pie crust
several times (both on the bottom and the sides) and place on a baking
tray. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the crust is partially baked and
just starting to brown. Remove from the oven and set aside.
To make the tofu-cashew custard, combine the cashews, tofu,
nutritional yeast, mustard, turmeric, and cornstarch in the bowl of a
food processor. Process until smooth. Set aside while you prepare the
sautéed vegetables.
To make the vegetables, heat the oil in a large pan over medium-high
heat. Add the shallots and a pinch of salt, and cook until mostly
translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the sliced asparagus and cook for an
additional 5 to 7 minutes, until the asparagus is bright green and just
tender when pierced with a fork. Add the garlic, cook for 1 minute or
so, until fragrant. Stir in the spinach, crumbled sausage, thyme, salt,
and pepper, and cook until heated through. Remove from the heat.
Stir the tofu-cashew custard into the vegetable-sausage mixture, until
everything is well-incorporated. Pour the mixture into the par-baked
pie shell, smoothing the top with the back of a spoon or spatula, and
transfer the quiche to the oven.
Bake the quiche for 40 to 50 minutes, until the custard is set and the
crust is golden brown. If the crust browns before the filling is ready,
cover the edges with strips of foil to prevent burning. Remove from
the oven, allow to cool for 10 minutes, then slice and serve.

MAKES 28 POTATO HALVES
Chef Linda: Working as a chef at Catskill Animal Sanctuary can often feel like an episode of
Dinner: Impossible. Whether we’re feeding five hundred people on a scorching summer day or
catering an upscale vegan cocktail party—in a barn, without a kitchen—we are always up for the
challenge! Hearts swelled and tongues wagged when we served our deviled potatoes at a cocktail
party for our beloved animal sponsors. Using common ingredients like potatoes and chickpeas to
create a familiar party staple assured folks that we can make food we love while respecting all
beings. With such simple changes, you’ll find how liberating living egg-free can be.
Allergens: Contains ingredients that may contain soy
Special Equipment: Blender
Ingredients
2 Tbsps olive oil
¼ tsp salt
14 small (about 2-inches in diameter) Yukon gold, red, or yellow potatoes
1 (15.5-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 large garlic cloves, roughly chopped, about 2 tsps
3 Tbsps vegan mayonnaise
2 Tbsps yellow mustard
1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
1 tsp black salt or regular salt
½ tsp ground turmeric
⅛ tsp ground cayenne pepper
Ground black pepper, to taste
¼ cup chives, finely chopped, for garnish
Paprika, for garnish
Directions
1.
2.
3.
4.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Drizzle the
lined baking tray with the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt. Cut
potatoes in half, then place them, cut-side down, on the baking tray.
Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until potatoes are soft and can be
pierced with a sharp knife. Check the face-down sides for a very light
golden color. The potatoes should not be allowed to brown otherwise
the bite will have resistance.
Place chickpeas, garlic, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, black salt,
turmeric, cayenne, and black pepper in a blender. Blend until
completely creamy and smooth and the chickpea skins are no longer
noticeable. This will take several minutes and require the sides to be
scraped down intermittently. Taste and adjust flavors, if desired. This
will taste strong, but when paired with the potato, it will mellow.
When the potatoes are tender, remove from oven and allow to cool for
a few minutes. Using a teaspoon or melon baller, scoop out the center
of each potato, leaving about ¼-inch border inside so that the potato is
stable enough to be filled. Place about one quarter of the scooped-out
potato centers into the blender with the chickpea mixture. This will
add stability to the filling. (Reserve remaining potato centers for use
in another recipe, such as thickening a soup.) Blend everything again,
scraping down the sides, until smooth. If necessary, add 1 or 2
teaspoons of water. This should have a very thick consistency.
Spoon 1 heaping teaspoon of mixture into the center of each potato.
Place the potatoes on a serving platter and garnish with chives and
paprika. Serve warm or at room temperature.
Cream Whit Bea an Cahe Fondu
MAKES 6 TO 8 GENEROUS APPETIZER SERVINGS
Chef Sara: Being vegan doesn’t mean you have to miss out on fondue! This dairy-free fondue
achieves its rich and creamy texture from cashews, butter beans, and waxy yellow potatoes. Potatoes
may seem like an odd addition to a vegan cheese sauce, but trust us: they have an almost magical
ability to turn a humble purée into a luscious, glossy cheese sauce. For an appetizer that’s sure to
please, serve the warm fondue with bread cubes (gluten-free, if desired), steamed broccoli, and sliced
Granny Smith apples. And if you really want to pull out all the stops, serve the fondue over pasta for
a decadent take on vegan mac ’n’ cheese.
Allergens: Contains nuts and soy
Special Equipment: Blender
Ingredients
2 Tbsps olive oil
2 large shallots, roughly chopped, about ½ cup
3 cloves garlic, peeled
3 cups vegetable stock
2 large yellow potatoes, peeled and diced, about 2 cups
1 (13.5- to 15.5-ounce) can butter beans, drained and rinsed
½ cup nutritional yeast
¾ cup raw cashews
½ cup dry white wine (for a nonalcoholic alternative, use a scant ½ cup apple juice and 2 tsps apple
cider vinegar)
2 Tbsps cornstarch
2 Tbsps white wine vinegar
2 Tbsps mellow white miso
1 Tbsp Dijon mustard
1 tsp salt, plus more to taste
Pinch of nutmeg, preferably freshly ground

To Serve
Cubed bread
Lightly steamed vegetables, like broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, green beans, potatoes, or asparagus
tips
Fresh fruit, like sliced apples, pears, figs
Directions
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the
shallots and cook for 5 minutes, until translucent. Add the garlic and
cook, while stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes more, until fragrant.
Add the vegetable stock, potatoes, butter beans, nutritional yeast, and
cashews, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until
the potatoes are soft, approximately 25 to 30 minutes. Allow to cool
slightly.
Carefully transfer to a blender and add the wine, cornstarch, vinegar,
miso, mustard, and salt. Use a towel to cover the blender lid to protect
your hands from steam, and blend until completely smooth. Rinse out
the pot and transfer the fondue mixture back to it.
Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent scorching, until
the fondue is bubbling and slightly thickened. Stir in the nutmeg.
Taste, adding additional salt if necessary. Serve immediately by using
a fondue pot or by placing the warm pot on a cutting board and
surrounding it with your “dippers.”

MAKES ABOUT 2 CUPS
Chef Linda: Like moths to a light, guests will gather round when you put this silky, rich spread on
the table at your next party. When ordinary mushrooms and walnuts meet the complex flavors of
miso and tamari, the result is indescribably addictive and decadent. Fresh rosemary teases the palate
with its subtle, piney fragrance. Reinvented with compassion, this simple but elegant pâté makes a
lovely winter or holiday appetizer and should grace your table often.
Allergens: Contains nuts, soy, and ingredients that may contain gluten
Special Equipment: Food processor
Ingredients
1 pound button mushrooms, quartered (or mix of exotic mushrooms)

until smooth. Serve in a small bowl or ramekin, garnished with the
chopped walnuts, and alongside an array of toasted baguette slices or
your favorite crackers.
Buf al Cauliflowe Bite
SERVES 6 TO 8
Chef Linda: Social gatherings include the unspoken promise that we will nibble before we dine. An
appetizer should pique our interest and take the edge off of our hunger. These buffalo cauliflower
bites are a compassionate riff on a Super Bowl staple. We developed the recipe for these spicy
nibbles at cocktail parties and staff lunches, and it has what it takes to become an MVP. Tender,
battered cauliflower is the perfect vehicle for a lip-smacking hot sauce and an outrageous dip.
Allergens: Contains gluten and soy
Make Ahead: The quick and creamy dip can be made 1 or 2 days in advance
Tip: Mirin, a type of rice wine, lends a sweetness and richness that for sauce
indescribably delicious. Use extra cauliflower and dip for your next salad, sandwich, or
pizza.
Ingredients
Batter
½ cup all-purpose flour
¼ cup cornstarch
2 Tbsps onion powder
1 Tbsp nutritional yeast
½ tsp salt
1 cup unsweetened nondairy milk
1 head of cauliflower, cut into bite-sized florets, about 5–6 heaping cups

But ernu-Sag Crotin
MAKES 16 TO 20 CROSTINI
Chef Sara: When it comes to classic pairings, butternut squash and sage are one of our favorites.
This elegant fall appetizer, created for a Thanksgiving cooking class at the Sanctuary, has several
steps, but most can be made well in advance to save time. Fried sage leaves are a simple and
delicious garnish. This is a wonderful appetizer with drinks, but be warned: they disappear quickly!
Allergens: Contains gluten, nuts, and soy
Special Equipment: Food processor
Make Ahead: The tofu-cashew ricotta and squash can be made several days in
advance. If making in advance, allow the squash to come to room temperature or
warm it before assembling crostini.
Tip: Reserve the leftover sage-infused olive oil to use in other recipes where a subtle
sage flavor is welcome. To simplify this dish further without sacrificing flavor, substitute
an artisanal spreadable vegan cheese for the homemade tofu-cashew ricotta.
Ingredients
Tofu-Cashew Ricotta
1 cup raw cashews, soaked for 4–8 hours, drained
¼ cup fresh lemon juice, from about 2 lemons
2 Tbsps mellow white miso
2–4 Tbsps nondairy milk
½ pound extra-firm tofu
½ tsp dried Italian seasoning
½ tsp salt, plus more to taste
Ground black pepper, to taste
Squash
1 small butternut squash, about 1½ pounds, peeled, seeded, and cut into ½-inch pieces, about 3 cups
2 Tbsps olive oil
1.
2.
3.
1 Tbsp maple syrup
Salt and pepper, to taste
Fried Sage Leaves
1 bunch fresh sage
¼ cup olive oil
Coarse salt, for sprinkling
To Assemble
1 baguette, sliced into ½-inch-thick slices, toasted
Directions
To make the tofu-cashew ricotta, combine the cashews, lemon juice,
and miso in the bowl of a food processor. Process until mostly
smooth, adding in nondairy milk as needed to keep the mixture
moving. Add the tofu, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper, and pulse a
few times, until mostly blended but not completely smooth—a bit of
texture is desirable. Taste, adjust seasoning if desired, and set aside
until needed, or refrigerate.
To make the squash, preheat the oven to 425°F and line a baking tray
with parchment. Pile the butternut squash on the baking tray and
drizzle with olive oil and maple syrup. Toss together to coat and
arrange in one layer on the baking sheet. Sprinkle generously with salt
and pepper, transfer to the oven, and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until
the squash is tender and starting to caramelize. Allow to cool at room
temperature or refrigerate.
To make the fried sage leaves, pinch the sage leaves from the thick
stems, discarding the stems. Line a large plate with paper towels. Heat
the oil in a small pan over medium-high heat. Working in small
batches of 6 to 8 leaves at a time, fry the leaves in the hot oil for 5 to
10 seconds on each side, flipping with a fork. The leaves should still
be green, with no hint of browning. Lift the leaves out to drain on the
paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining leaves. Sprinkle
4.
them with salt and allow to cool completely. They will crisp up as
they cool. Fried sage leaves may be used immediately, or stored in an
airtight container at room temperature for two to three days.
To assemble the crostini, spread a generous 1 tablespoon of cashewtofu ricotta on a baguette slice, top with a few cubes of butternut
squash, and place a sage leaf on top. Serve immediately. Store any
remaining ricotta in the refrigerator for up to five days.

MAKES 16 TO 20 CROSTINI
Chef Linda: Crostini is a blank slate, ready to be adorned with whatever is seasonal, beautiful, and
delicious. In this recipe, we roast fresh grapes with a drizzle of olive oil and salt to tame their
boisterous, juicy sweetness, making them behave with a bit more sophistication. With just a few
ordinary ingredients, we transform cashews into a luscious, savory vegan ricotta spread that serves as
an excellent bridge between the crispy bread and tender grapes. These appetizers are lovely for
company, but fuss-free enough to indulge in at any time.
Allergens: Contains gluten and nuts
Special Equipment: Food processor
Make Ahead: The cashew ricotta can be made several days in advance.
Tip: Substitute a spreadable vegan cheese for the homemade cashew ricotta.
Ingredients
2 cups seedless red grapes
1 Tbsp olive oil
¼ tsp coarse salt
Cashew Ricotta
1½ cups raw cashews, soaked in water for 15–30 minutes, drained
2 large cloves garlic, peeled
3 Tbsps fresh lemon juice
2 Tbsps nutritional yeast
1 tsp onion powder
½ tsp salt
⅓ cup water
To Serve
1 large baguette, about 14–16 inches long
2 Tbsps fresh thyme leaves
1.

3.
4.
Directions
Preheat oven to 400°F and line a baking tray with parchment. Cut
grapes in half lengthwise and place on the tray in a pile. Drizzle with
the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt. Toss together and arrange cutside down in a single layer. Roast for 10 to 12 minutes. Grapes should
get a just little wrinkly and slightly browned along the edges. Remove
from oven and let cool. Transfer to a bowl or plate and set aside the
baking tray and parchment.
To make the cashew ricotta, drain and rinse the cashews. Place them
in a food processor with garlic, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, onion
powder, salt, and water. Blend, for several minutes until completely
smooth, stopping to scrape down sides, and adding a little more water,
as necessary. Taste and adjust seasonings, if desired.
Cut baguette into ¼-inch-wide diagonal slices. Lay slices on the same
baking tray lined with parchment and broil in the oven for 1 to 2
minutes, watching carefully, until bread is lightly toasted. Flip slices
over and put under broiler again for another minute or so. Remove
from the oven and cool slightly.
To assemble, smear a generous tablespoon of cashew ricotta on each
slice of bread. Top with several grapes and repeat. Arrange on plate
and garnish with thyme leaves. Serve immediately. Store extra ricotta
in the refrigerator for up to five days.
Gree Spanakopit Bite
MAKES 18 TO 20 PIECES
Chef Linda: Spanakopita, or spinach pie, is a traditional Greek dish made with phyllo dough,
spinach-cheese filling, butter, and eggs. Consider this recipe an act of love . . . or showmanship.
Working with phyllo may seem intimidating, but only until you’ve done it once. Look for vegan
phyllo in the freezer case of well-stocked grocery stores; many brands are also “accidentally” vegan
because they don’t use eggs. Impossibly crispy and flaky on the outside, and tender and salty on the
inside, this recipe demonstrates the possibilities that abound when you cook with compassion.
Allergens: Contains gluten and soy
Make Ahead: The tofu feta can be made several days in advance.
Tip: Substitute vegan cream cheese for tofu feta, though the result will be denser and
moister. Extras freeze well or heat up quickly in a toaster oven for light dinner.
Ingredients
Tofu Feta
1 (14- to 16-ounce) package of firm tofu
3 Tbsps mellow white miso
3 Tbsps nutritional yeast
3 Tbsps fresh lemon juice
2 Tbsps olive oil
1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp salt
Spanakopita
2 Tbsps olive oil, plus extra for brushing
½ medium onion, finely chopped, about ½ cup
½ tsp salt, plus extra for sprinkling
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
2 scallions, trimmed and finely chopped, about ¼ cup
10 ounces frozen, chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed to remove excess water
¼ cup nutritional yeast
¼ tsp ground nutmeg
1½ cups tofu feta (from recipe above)
1 pound package vegan phyllo dough, thawed in the refrigerator overnight
Directions
Drain, rinse, and press tofu (pg. 6).
To make the tofu feta, whisk together the miso, nutritional yeast,
lemon juice, olive oil, vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt
in a large bowl. The mixture will be thick. Cut tofu into ¼-inch cubes
and add to the bowl with marinade. Stir gently to coat tofu. The tofu
feta will be more flavorful if it’s left to marinate for several hours or
overnight, but proceed to baking if time does not allow.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Arrange
tofu in a single layer and bake for about 25 minutes, or until cubes
start to turn golden brown. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.
To make the spanakopita, increase oven temperature to 375°F. Line
two baking trays with parchment. To make the filling, heat olive oil in
a large pan over medium heat. Add onions and salt. Cook for 8 to 10
minutes or until they are soft and translucent. Add scallions and stir.
Add spinach, nutritional yeast, and nutmeg. When spinach is hot and
everything is fully combined, crumble tofu feta into the pan and
gently mix, leaving chunks of cheese. Remove from heat and set aside
to cool.
On a clean countertop, carefully unroll the phyllo dough, laying it out
with the longest side horizontal to the edge of the counter. Take one
sheet and lay it flat, then brush with a little olive oil (or use your
hands to spread the oil). Place another sheet on top, brush again. Then
place a third sheet on top and do not oil. Using a sharp knife, cut the
stacked sheets horizontally into strips about 3½ inches wide. Place 1
6.
tablespoon of filling in the bottom corner of one strip, closest to you.
Fold the end corner over till it meets the opposite edge. Press gently to
even out the filling inside. Take the triangle and fold it up and away
from you, then continue to fold back and forth, making a triangle
pocket. Place it on the prepared baking tray.
Repeat the process until all the filling is gone. Brush each triangle
with a little olive oil and sprinkle with a bit of salt. Bake for about 20
minutes (with both trays in the oven) or until the phyllo turns golden
brown. Remove from the oven and serve immediately.

MAKES 1 (4- TO 5-INCH) BALL OR SEVERAL SMALLER ONES, DEPENDING ON SIZE
Chef Sara: This smoky, pecan-crusted cheese ball—a veganized version of the cheese ball my
grandmother, Lucy, used to serve friends and family—has achieved legendary status among its fans.
Soaked cashews and coconut oil stand in for the traditional cream cheese, and a mix of bold, savory
seasonings lend a rich, familiar flavor. Serve with crackers and crisp vegetables for a surefire hit at
your next get-together.

Variation: Cranberry-Walnut Cheese Balls: begin the recipe as written, omitting the
smoked paprika. After scraping the mixture into a bowl, fold in ½ cup chopped dried
cranberries and 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme. Roll the chilled cheese ball in
½ cup chopped, toasted walnuts instead of pecans.
Ingredients
1½ cups raw cashews, soaked for 4–8 hours, and drained
¼ cup nutritional yeast
1 Tbsp mellow white miso
1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
¾ tsp salt
½ tsp garlic powder
½ tsp onion powder
½ tsp smoked paprika
¼ cup water
¼ cup refined coconut oil, melted
½ cup chopped pecans, for coating
Directions
1.
2.
Drain and rinse the cashews. Place the cashews, nutritional yeast,
miso, vinegar, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and
water in the bowl of a food processor. Process on high speed for
several minutes, scraping down the bowl as necessary, until mostly
smooth. With the machine running, stream in the melted coconut oil,
and process again until very smooth and creamy. This may take a few
minutes. Use a spatula to scrape the mixture into a bowl. Cover and
refrigerate for at least 4 hours, until firm enough to shape into a ball.
Place the chopped pecans on a plate. Scoop the cheese ball mixture
out of its bowl, form into one large ball or several smaller ones (a
flattened disc shape also works well), and roll in the chopped nuts,
pressing the nuts gently into the surface of the cheese ball to help
them stick. Refrigerate until ready to eat.

Bake Nu-Chee Whee
MAKES 1 (6-INCH) WHEEL
Chef Linda: Cheese seems to be the last holdout for many people who want to go vegan. Luckily,
recipes like this will satisfy the craving for that creamy, salty, and rich flavor. We created this recipe
for our popular Compassionate Cuisine cooking class “Life after Cheese” to demonstrate how
versatile nuts can be in creating plant-based cheese. By baking, we get a dense, firm, sliceable result
with a gorgeous toasted crust on the outside. The short list of ingredients and simple technique make
it the perfect appetizer to serve at parties, crumble on salads, or keep in the fridge for your own secret
pleasure. Add fresh, chopped herbs, like oregano or rosemary if you like. Do yourself a favor and
make a double batch.
Allergens: Contains nuts
Special Equipment: Food processor or blender
Ingredients
1½ cups raw cashews (not soaked)
¼ cup nutritional yeast
3 Tbsps lemon juice
½ cup water
3 Tbsps olive oil
2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
¾ tsp salt
Directions
Preheat oven to 350°F. Place all ingredients in a blender or food
processor and blend until very smooth.
Oil a 6-inch oven-safe ceramic or glass bowl and pour the nut mixture
into the bowl. Bake for about 25 minutes. It’s ready when the top,
puffs up, feels dry, and turns a light golden-brown. Remove from the
oven and let stand for about 15 minutes. Slide a sharp knife around
the perimeter of the bowl, then turn it upside down on a cutting board
or plate. Serve immediately, or store sealed in the refrigerator for up
to a week. This can also be frozen for up to three months.

MAKES 20 TO 25 APPETIZER-SIZED MUSHROOMS
Chef Linda: Stuffed mushrooms always cause a murmur in the room. Guests swoon at this perfect
morsel, which is sure to appease their appetite. So often, recipes for the perfect stuffed mushroom
obsess over cheesiness or meatiness while missing out on ingredients that complement the
mushroom, choosing those that suffocate it instead. Our simple, inexpensive, and compassionate
approach relies on walnuts and kale for the filling. While this recipe is easy enough to make on the
day you need them, it can also be made in advance and baked just before your guests arrive, filling
the house with the welcoming scent of herbs, garlic, and all that is right in the world.
Allergens: Contains nuts
Make Ahead: Follow the recipe without baking the stuffed mushrooms. Instead, cover
and refrigerate for up to 2 days, then bake at 375°F for about 15 minutes before
serving. The filling can also be made 1 or 2 days in advance.
Tip: To create a hearty main dish, stuff portobello mushrooms instead of button
mushrooms.
Ingredients
20–24 ounces large button mushrooms
3 Tbsps olive oil, divided
1 tsp salt, divided
3 large cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp
1 cup finely chopped kale
¾ cup walnuts, finely chopped (or raw pumpkin or sunflower seeds)
½ cup breadcrumbs, regular or gluten-free
1 Tbsp nutritional yeast (optional)
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried thyme
Directions
1.
2.
3.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Wipe dirt from mushrooms, remove stems,
finely chop, and set aside. Place mushroom caps in a large bowl.
Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of oil and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of salt.
Toss to coat and arrange stem-side down in a casserole dish. Bake for
10 to 12 minutes until mushrooms have released their moisture and
turned dark brown.
While the mushrooms are baking, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of
oil in a large pan. Add the chopped mushroom stems, garlic, and
remaining ½ teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 8
minutes, or until the stems have browned and released their liquid.
Add kale, walnuts, breadcrumbs, nutritional yeast, oregano, and
thyme. Stir and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, or until the kale is
bright green and herbs are fragrant.
Spoon walnut-kale mixture into the mushroom caps, packing it tightly.
Return mushrooms to casserole dish, stuffed-side up, and bake for 12
to 15 minutes, until tops are lightly browned and crispy. Serve at room
temperature.

CHARLIE’S QUESTIONS
I am walking past the pond on my way to visit Leo, our special needs baby
goat, when I bump into a “Family Tour” standing between two pastures:
one where four horses live, the other occupied by four cows, including my
“son” Tucker, a massive steer who’s lived with us since a mother and
daughter saved his life ten years ago when he was a young calf on his way
to slaughter.
I stop, and tour guide Em invites me to say hello. There are few things
in life I enjoy more than connecting kids with animals, so I happily oblige.
The group is comprised of one family of five, three additional families
of two or three, and two adults who’ve joined this “G-rated” tour. We don’t
discuss agribusiness on this tour. We don’t talk about the impact of our diet
on the planet or the other species who inhabit it. We don’t talk about how
meat and dairy consumption wreak havoc on human health. Nope. Rather,
the Family Tour is designed to foster meaningful connection. It’s designed
to show our guests, particularly the pint-sized ones, that cows, chickens,
and pigs are as loving, affectionate, and uniquely wonderful as dogs and
cats. We sit on the ground with the chickens. If they want to be held, we
hold turkeys Michael and Imogen. We kiss the pigs. Well, some of us do. In
other words, the Family Tour is a lovefest. We’re planting seeds.
“Kids!” I say, facing the group. “Do you want to meet the cows?”
A chorus of voices responds, “YES!”
I introduce myself and ask the kids’ names: Roxie, Henry, Lucy,
Charlie, and Gina. All but Gina are names of current or past residents,
which I explain by saying, “Lucy, we have a pig named after you,” and so
forth. Two other children, both infants, are both sacked out in Dads’
backpacks. I forego the name game with them.
“I’m so glad you want to meet the cows, because I haven’t seen them in
about ten days, and I miss them!” I explain.
“Why do you miss them?” asks four-year-old Charlie. Charlie has deep
brown eyes, fair skin, a smattering of freckles . . . and a twinkle in his eye.
“Because they are my friends,” I explain.
“Are the horses your friends?” Charlie asks.
“They sure are!”
“Are the chickens your friends?”
Mom shoots me a “You’d better nip this in the bud” glance, so I kneel
down right in front of Freckle Face and say, “If we’re gonna go out with the
cows, we’ve got to practice something important.” And then, gauging his
size, I ask his age: Charlie is four.
“And do you ever get a little silly . . . a little goofy?”
“A lot!” Charlie offers.
“Well, there’s a cow out in the field named Benjamin, and he’s four
years old, too. Boy, can he get goofy, just like you. He’s a very, very sweet
cow, but if he gets a little excited, we don’t want him to hurt us by
accident.” This is the kid-friendly version of, “Parents, keep your eyes on
this fella.”
I demonstrate a quick, determined jump in place as I throw my hands
skyward and shout a sharp, loud, “HAH!” We learned years ago that when a
seven-hundred-pound young steer who has no idea of his own strength is
barreling toward you, this is the best way to ensure that he stops before
you’re potentially in a heap of trouble. (Mind you, Benjamin has never
acted like this with a tour. The activity is merely a precaution.)
Together, we practice. The grown ups shout “HAH!” and the kids shout
“HAH!,” though little Henry will only perform when hiding behind his
mom. Good enough.
“Let’s go,” I instruct, reaching for a couple of small hands. Charlie
offers his.
It’s been an unusually wet late summer, so we have to pick our way
through the pasture, avoiding small pools of water. “Also,” I add, because
kids find hyperbole about poop hilarious, “watch out for poop piles. Cows
poop about nine million times a day.”
“That’s disgusting,” Henry says.
“I have a feeling, Henry, that you would not want to live on a
sanctuary,” I say to the little man.
“No way,” says Henry, who’s clutching Monster, a pink unicorn with a
neon green mane, in his hand while explaining that he wants to live in a
castle.
Charlie has asked at least a dozen more questions on our walk out to
Tucker and friends, and he doesn’t stop when he lays eyes on the 2,500-
pound-plus beast lying thirty feet in front of us. He wants to know if Tucker
is “the mama horse.”
I explain first that Tucker is a cow, and, second, that he is the stepdad in
this family of four—stepparents Tucker and Sadie, and stepkids Benjamin
and Blossom—who love each other very much. Big-hearted, gentle Tucker
especially loves people and enjoys having visitors, so I sit directly in front
of his massive head, legs crossed, and begin massaging his ears, his cheeks,
his wide forehead. His eyes droop as he relaxes into my hands. As I tell his
story and share cow facts that might be interesting to children, I tap my
thigh.
“Come on guys, who wants to give Tucker a kiss?” I ask, and then by
way of example plant a kiss above Tucker’s right eye, another one on his
cheek, another on his wet nose. Tucker responds with a scratchy kiss
delivered to my cheek.
“I do!” shouts Charlie. “I want to kiss him!”
“That’s disgusting,” Henry says.
A single toss of Tucker’s head would send Charlie sailing, but the tiny
child walks confidently to me, settles into my lap, and sits a few inches in
front of a cow head the size of his entire body. He plants a kiss on the
bridge of Tucker’s nose, and a wide smile spreads across his face.
We spend a couple moments, and then Lucy tiptoes over, working
through her fear, and places her small hand on Tucker’s neck. Even Henry,
encouraged by his dad, comes eventually. He perches on the edge of my
knee and tentatively strokes Tucker’s face once before catapulting back
towards Dad’s reassuring embrace.
A few minutes later, these tiny hearts and I climb the fence and enter a
pasture where horses Barclay, Arabelle, Destiny, and Julius live. We talk
about horse teeth and, again, about poop (“That’s disgusting,” Henry
announces). We also talk about how soft the horses are and about their
“hair.” Henry, guardian of Monster the plastic pink unicorn with the flowing
neon mane, is fascinated by the horses’ manes and tails. Parents ask
questions about the individual horses, and I offer abbreviated versions of
their rescue stories because this group is worrisomely oblivious to the
instructions about keeping their kids safe, and my focus has become more
about watching the children.
One by one, I lift them to the horse’s faces so they can, if they choose,
safely plant more kisses.
We reassemble in front of one of five pig pastures next, and I ask, “Who
wants to kiss pigs?!”
Henry says emphatically, “I definitely do not want to kiss pigs.” Nor
does his sister. Nor does Roxie, and the littlest children are still fast asleep.
Charlie is the only taker.
“You’re not going to believe how great this is,” I say to him as we
march out into the field. “I’m so excited I can hardly stand it! Are you
excited, Charlie?”
“Yeah! I think my face is going to come off!”
I call to Moses, our sweet, spotted boy, who turns and ambles toward
us. Charlie is all breath and rapt attention, sitting in my lap as we wait for
the big moment. I wrap my arms around his chest; his tiny heart races.
But when the six-hundred-pound pig is before us, there’s only time for a
brief intro, because Moses has already spotted the rest of the group at the
fence line. They’re offering willow branches, a favorite treat for most of our
species. No matter: Moses utters a friendly “hello” as Charlie places his
hand flatly on the pig’s cool, moist snout. For a few seconds, pig eyes meet
human eyes, and I know this is a moment Charlie won’t soon forget.
Cajoled by their parents, Henry and Lucy have entered the field not for
pig kisses, but for pig butt scratches. I demonstrate how to scratch
forcefully to penetrate Moses’ thick skin, and though he uses “disgusting” a
dozen times, Henry starts to giggle as Moses responds to the treatment by
wiggling from side to side.
“Mmmph,” says Moses.
“He’s saying thanks,” I tell Henry.
A smile, the first one I’ve seen, spreads across Henry’s face.
An hour after I usurped Em’s tour, I kneel down to be at eye-level with
the children as we say goodbye. As Charlie’s dad whispers to me, “Charlie
wants to give you a hug,” the freckle-faced imp comes over and envelopes
me in his four-year-old arms. We stay that way for a long, long time. And
then, to my astonishment, Henry comes toward me, arms outstretched. I
can’t see it, but I think I feel another smile.
Some days, a warm bowl of soup can feel like just the hug we need. Made with love
and compassion, it can tease out even the most reluctant smile. Days like these were
made for peanut-y sweet potato stew (pg. 62), Smoky Three-Bean Chili (pg. 74), and
humble lentil stew (pg. 65). Got a little spring in your step? We’ve got a soup for that,
too.
Soup an tew
We believe in soup. Whether carefully constructed or made with
lazy abandon, we think most days should have some soup in them.
To cure or soothe, to nourish or indulge, soups and stews are a way
to summon and invite a list of ingredients to work magic together.
We could go on for pages, listing our favorites and making up new
ones, but accept these selected recipes as an offering to whet your
appetite, then go ahead and create your own.

SERVES 4 TO 6
Chef Linda: This inviting stew is a study in taste, ease, and satisfaction. Simple ingredients dispel
the myth that vegan cooking is expensive and uses hard-to-find ingredients. The power in creating
plant-based food comes not only from what we leave out, but also what we include. Fresh ginger and
warming spices transform everyday sweet potatoes and ordinary peanut butter into a meal you’ll
hunger for again, before you even set your spoon down. Compassionate. Magical. Healthy. It’s one of
our favorites.
Allergens: Contains peanuts
Make Ahead: Use leftover rice or your favorite grain for an extra-hearty meal.
Ingredients
2 tsps coconut oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped, about 1 cup
1 tsp salt
3 large cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp
2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated, about 1 Tbsp
1 tsp ground cumin
½ tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp ground turmeric
3 cups vegetable broth
⅓ cup unsalted, smooth peanut butter
¼ cup tomato paste
1–2 Tbsps sriracha or hot sauce
2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into ¼-inch cubes, about 2½ cups
1 (15.5-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed (or 1½ cups cooked)
¼ cup peanuts, salted or unsalted, roughly chopped
2 scallions, thinly sliced, about ¼ cup
Chopped cilantro, for garnish

For Serving
2–3 cups cooked rice or your favorite cooked grain, heated
Directions
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and salt. Cook,
stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until onion is soft and
translucent. Stir in garlic, ginger, cumin, cinnamon, and turmeric.
Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, until garlic is fragrant.
Add vegetable broth, peanut butter, tomato paste, and sriracha. Stir
until combined. Add sweet potatoes and chickpeas. Bring to a gentle
boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook covered for about 20 minutes, or
until the sweet potatoes are fork-tender. To serve, scoop rice or grain
into a large bowl, ladle stew over top. Top with chopped peanuts,
scallions, and cilantro.
Da Makhan (India Bea te)
SERVES 6 TO 8
Chef Linda: This is not your ordinary bean stew. At once, it is both exotic yet humble, boasting an
intoxicating array of spices even as it uses economical, simple legumes. Dal is a broad term that
refers to legumes (lentils, peas, and beans) that are cooked and spiced to perfection in Indian cuisine.
The legumes used here can generally be found in the ethnic aisle of well-stocked grocery stores. Dal
Makhani is traditionally made with clarified butter (ghee) and heavy cream, but we employ coconut
cream as a healthy and compassionate replacement. The result is a luscious, decadent dish without
the cruelty or the calories. Don’t be put off by the list of ingredients. This recipe requires very little
prep time and the ingredients are mainly spices that can be used again and again to lend excitement to
soups, stews, and vegetable dishes. Using a slow cooker makes this a fuss-free dish, but cook it on
the stovetop if you prefer.
Special Equipment: Slow cooker, optional
Tip: This blend of spices is superb, but substitute a curry spice blend like garam
masala for the spices here if you have to.
Ingredients
1 cup urad/dry whole black lentils, soaked overnight in water, drained (or unsoaked green or French
lentils)
½ cup rajma/dry kidney beans, soaked overnight in water, drained
1 medium onion, finely chopped, about 1 cup
1½ cups diced tomatoes (fresh or canned)
1–2 green chili peppers, depending on spice level, minced
2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated, about 1 Tbsp
3 large garlic cloves, minced, about 1 Tbsp
1 Tbsp ground coriander
2 tsps ground fenugreek
2 tsps chili powder
1½ tsps salt
1 tsp ground cardamom
1.
2.
½ tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp ground turmeric
¼ tsp ground cloves
¼ tsp ground black pepper
4 cups water or vegetable broth
⅓ cup coconut cream
Chopped cilantro, chopped for garnish
Directions
Add all the ingredients except the coconut cream and cilantro to the
slow cooker. Stir well. Cook on high for 8 hours. Add a little water to
thin if necessary. If cooking on the stovetop, add all the ingredients
except the coconut cream and cilantro into a large pot and simmer for
about 50 to 60 minutes. If the beans are still firm, continue to simmer
for another 10 to 15 minutes.
When done cooking, gently mash the beans against the side of the
slow cooker or pot with the back of a wooden spoon. Stir in coconut
cream and serve garnished with cilantro.

SERVES 4 TO 6
Chef Linda: There are days when almost nothing will warm or fill you up. This is a stew for those
days. It’s rustic, satisfying, full of wholesome ingredients, and has just enough heat to thaw you from
the inside out. Sometimes the humblest ingredients take on new personalities when paired and spiced
differently. Succulent sweet potatoes marry beautifully with tender and toothsome lentils. A couple of
chipotle peppers, some chili powder, and cumin bring this dish to life. For a splendid topping that
brings the flavors together, make Cashew Herb Cream (pg. 189). It’s hardly optional, in fact, we urge
you to make a double batch and use it on everything, from rice and beans to our Smoky Three-Bean
Chili (pg. 74).
Allergens: Contains nuts

Ruti Summe Gazpach
SERVES 6 TO 8
Chef Linda: Warm weather and end-of-summer tomatoes are made for gazpacho. It’s a simple,
casual recipe that celebrates the flavors and colors of nature’s bounty. The texture of this soup is
completely up to you—some love it puréed; others like it chunky. (We like it on the chunky side with
flecks of color.) Together, the tomatoes and vinegar create a bright, zesty flavor. If you’ve missed the
peak of tomato season and still crave the tangy goodness of gazpacho, canned tomatoes are a
perfectly acceptable substitution. We know from experience!
Allergens: Contains soy and ingredients that may contain gluten
Special Equipment: Blender
Tip: Serve this with a thick, crusty piece of bread slathered with good hummus
Ingredients
3 pounds fresh tomatoes, cored and cut into large chunks, about 3–4 cups
2 red bell peppers (or 1 red and 1 green), seeded and roughly chopped, about 2 cups
1 large cucumber, peeled, seeded, and cut into large chunks, about 2 cups
1 cup canned tomatoes with juice

Ne Orlean Peca Gumb
SERVES 4 TO 6
Chef Linda: Gumbo originated from the Louisiana Creole people during the eighteenth century.
Hearty, rich, and strongly seasoned, the dish combines the ingredients and culinary practices of
several cultures and traditionally includes sausage, chicken, or shellfish. Remaking gumbo without
animal products proved to be full of opportunities for creativity. This version relies on pecan halves
for its meatiness. If you’re transitioning to a plant-based diet and looking for something hearty and
flavorful, give this gumbo a try.
Allergens: Contains nuts
Tip: Use sautéed vegan sausage for a nut-free version
Ingredients
Cajun Seasoning
1½ tsps smoked paprika
1½ tsps garlic powder
½ tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp dried thyme
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp cayenne pepper
Gumbo
5 Tbsps olive oil, divided
2 heaping cups quartered button mushrooms

5.
1 green bell pepper, chopped in ¼-inch pieces, about 1 cup
1 red bell pepper, chopped in ¼-inch pieces, about 1 cup
3 large cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp
3 Tbsps Cajun Seasoning (from recipe above)
3 cups vegetable broth
2 large zucchinis, trimmed and cut into ½-inch pieces, about 4 cups
1 cup raw pecan halves
1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
To Serve
3–4 cups cooked white rice
2 scallions, thinly sliced, about ¼ cup
Directions
To make the Cajun seasoning, mix all the ingredients together in a jar
or zip-top plastic bag.
To make the gumbo, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large, heavybottomed pot over medium heat. Add mushrooms and salt. Cook,
stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until mushrooms have
browned and released their liquid. Transfer mushrooms to a bowl and
set aside.
Heat remaining 3 tablespoons of oil in the same pot over low heat.
Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring continually for about 5 minutes. It’s
important to stir continually and not allow the mixture to stick to the
bottom and burn.
When the flour has turn a golden-dark brown, add onion, celery, bell
peppers, and garlic. Cook for about 10 minutes, or until vegetables
have softened. Add the Cajun seasoning, vegetable broth, zucchini,
pecans, and cooked mushrooms.
Let the stew come to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until zucchini is
tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Taste and adjust
seasonings if desired. To serve, spoon rice into the bottom of deep
bowls and ladle the gumbo on top. Garnish with scallions.

Roate Cauliflowe Garli Sou
SERVES 4 TO 6
Chef Linda: How we treat a vegetable like cauliflower depends on the season. In spring, when we
crave lightness, we steam. Summer weather invites us outdoors where a grill makes quick and tasty
work of our food. Colder weather beckons us to turn on the oven and roast. Roasting concentrates
flavors and satisfies cold weather cravings. This soup was originally developed for a Thanksgiving
cooking class to demonstrate that humble, versatile, and economical ingredients are often at the core
of vegan cooking, and the soup’s thick texture reminds us that we do not have to rely on dairy to add
creaminess. This earthy soup is rich, flavorful, restorative, and shamefully simple to make. Just a few
good reasons to make a double batch!
Special Equipment: Blender or immersion blender
Ingredients
1 large head cauliflower (about 2–2½ pounds) cut into florets
10–15 large cloves garlic, peeled
1 medium onion, peeled and thinly sliced, about 1 cup
1 Tbsp fresh thyme or 2 tsps dried
3 Tbsps olive oil
1 tsp salt
6 cups vegetable broth
1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
Fresh thyme sprigs, for garnish
Directions
Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Place
cauliflower, garlic, onions, and thyme on the baking tray and drizzle
with the olive oil. Gently toss together and sprinkle with salt. Roast
2.
for about 30 to 35 minutes or until all the vegetables are soft and
medium brown.
Heat the broth while the vegetables are roasting. When the vegetables
are done, pick out a few small florets of browned cauliflower for
garnish and set aside. Transfer remaining vegetables to a blender. Add
the warm vegetable broth and lemon juice and carefully blend.
Caution, it’s hot, so remove the plastic handle in the lid and use a
towel to gently cover the top of the hole in the blender lid to let steam
escape during the blending process. Blend until chunky-smooth,
leaving tiny bits and pieces of browned vegetables for visual appeal.
Do not overblend into a purée. Alternatively, use an immersion/hand
blender. To serve, ladle soup into bowls and place one or two small
florets on top and a small sprig of thyme.
Moquec (Brazilia te)
SERVES 6 TO 8
Chef Linda: Thick and luscious, and almost too good to share, this vegan Moqueca recipe was
inspired by a Brazilian seafood stew. Our compassionate version uses fried plantains, tofu, hearts of
palm, and diced potatoes to create a gorgeous and uniquely flavorful dish. Since this was originally a
seafood stew, we used wakame, a sea vegetable, to create a mild broth that lends a subtle taste of the
sea. Although the ingredient list may look lengthy and a little unfamiliar, this silky, tangy stew comes
together fairly easily, and the result is more than worth the effort. We created this recipe for a
multicultural wedding hosted at the Sanctuary. Guests came together from different countries,
speaking different languages, to celebrate a joyous event. Like that wedding, our Moqueca is proof
that the language of love is universal.
Allergens: Contains gluten and soy
Make Ahead: This stew can be served over rice that’s been made in advance.
Tip: Farofa, the crunchy topping, is an essential condiment to many Brazilian dishes.
It’s made from manioc meal, the ground root of cassava, and can be found online or in
ethnic markets. Panko breadcrumbs are a perfect substitute.
Ingredients
3 cups vegetable broth
½ cup dried wakame or other sea vegetable (like kombu, hijiki, or arame)
5 Tbsps coconut oil, divided
1 large ripe plantain, peeled and sliced into ¼-inch slices
3 Tbsps all-purpose flour (or cornstarch for gluten-free version)
½ medium onion, finely chopped, about ½ cup
1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped into ¼-inch pieces, about 1 cup
2 large garlic cloves, minced, about 2 tsps
1 tsp ground paprika
1 tsps salt
½ tsp ground coriander
½ tsp crushed red pepper flakes
1.
2.
3.
2 large tomatoes, seeded and chopped into ¼-inch pieces, about 2 cups
1 cup thickly sliced hearts of palm
4 ounces firm tofu, cut into ½-inch cubes
1 large potato, peeled, and cut into ½-inch cubes
1 (14.5-ounce) can coconut milk
2 Tbsps fresh lime juice
Chopped cilantro or parsley, for garnish
4–6 cups cooked rice for serving, optional
Topping (Farofa)
2 Tbsps coconut oil
1 large garlic clove, minced, about 1 tsp
½ cup manioc meal or breadcrumbs (regular or gluten-free)
¼ tsp salt
Directions
In a small pot, simmer vegetable broth with wakame for about 10
minutes. Pour the broth into a bowl through a mesh strainer to remove
the sea vegetables, if desired, or leave some in for extra taste, texture,
and nutrition.
Heat 2 tablespoons of coconut oil in a pan over medium-high heat.
When the oil is hot, lay plantain slices in a single layer in the pan and
cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until nicely browned. Plantains
should be fork-tender when done. Transfer to a paper towel-lined
plate to drain. Set aside the pan.
Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of coconut oil in a large pot over
medium heat. Add flour and cook for about 2 minutes, while stirring,
until it darkens slightly. Add onions, peppers, garlic, paprika, salt,
coriander, and crushed red pepper flakes. Cover and cook until onions
and peppers have softened slightly, about 8 minutes. Add tomatoes,
hearts of palm, tofu, potatoes, vegetable broth, and coconut milk.
Simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, until all the vegetables have softened
and potatoes can be pierced with a fork. Stir in lime juice and
plantains.

5.
To make the farofa, use the pan from the plantains. Heat oil over
medium heat. Add garlic, manioc meal or breadcrumbs, and salt.
Cook, while stirring, for about 5 minutes until light golden brown and
fragrant. Be careful not to burn as it goes from golden to dark brown
quickly. Empty into a small bowl and serve with the moqueca, as a
garnish.
Serve in bowls garnished with farofa and cilantro.

MAKES 8 SERVINGS
Chef Sara: Some of our Compassionate Cuisine cooking classes are designed to focus on certain
techniques, ingredients, or nutritional concerns. This flavorful stew was created for a class on plantbased iron and calcium sources. Aside from being incredibly delicious and quick to assemble, it is a
nutritional powerhouse. Iron-rich cannellini beans mingle with calcium-rich collard greens, while the
addition of tomatoes and red bell peppers contribute the vitamin C necessary for aiding in the
absorption of plant-based iron. Served over quinoa, another great source of iron, this is a nourishing
dinner you’ll turn to again and again.
Ingredients
2 Tbsps olive oil
2 medium red onions, chopped, about 2 cups
2 medium red bell peppers, chopped, about 2 cups
1-inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and minced, about 1 tsp
4 large cloves garlic, minced, about 1⅓ Tbsps
1 tsp chili powder
½ tsp smoked paprika
¼–½ tsp cayenne pepper, to taste
3 cups vegetable stock or water
1 (15.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 large bunch collard greens, chopped into bite-size pieces, 6–7 cups
1 tsp salt, plus more to taste
Ground black pepper, to taste
2 (15.5-ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed (or 3 cups cooked)
Directions

to 10 minutes. Add the bell peppers, ginger, and garlic, and cook a
few minutes more, until the peppers are just beginning to soften. Stir
in the spices, stock, tomatoes, collard greens, and salt and pepper to
taste, and mix well. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat to low, and
simmer for 20 minutes.
Add the cannellini beans and simmer, covered, for an additional 10
minutes to allow the flavors to blend. Taste, adjust salt and pepper as
needed, and serve.

MAKES 6 TO 8 SERVINGS
Chef Sara: If you’re like us and always have sweet potatoes, frozen corn, canned beans, and tomato
purée on hand, this recipe practically makes itself! The result is a mildly to moderately spicy chili.
Feel free to substitute whatever beans you have for the three we’ve chosen, but you’ll need a total of
4½ cups cooked beans. For a real treat, make our Cashew Sour Cream (pg. 188) and serve with a
generous dollop on top.
Tip: Poblano chiles can be tricky to find; if so, substitute green or red bell peppers for
a slightly different, though no less delicious, flavor.
Ingredients

1 Tbsp chili powder
2 tsps ground cumin
1½ tsps ground coriander
1 tsp ground chipotle powder

cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and spice
blend. Cook for an addition minute or two, until fragrant.
Stir in the sweet potato, corn, beans, tomatoes, broth, and salt. Bring
to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer for 25 to 30 minutes,
until the sweet potatoes are fork-tender. Add the lime juice, taste and

hiitak H an Sou Sou
SERVES 4 TO 6
Chef Linda: In our popular global cuisine cooking class, we tackled a vegan version of a Chinese
takeout favorite: hot and sour soup. Traditionally made with pork, eggs, and beef broth, our recipe
eliminated those ingredients while still coming alive with flavor, texture, and zing. To achieve the
true essence of the soup, you must find harmony between the hot and the sour; an imbalance will be
most disagreeable. White pepper is essential, and you’ll know when it’s just right. The first bite may
singe your sensibilities, but by the second, that fire will feel more like embers warming you from the
inside out. And when the third bite follows, you’ll wonder whether you have enough ingredients to
make another batch.
Allergens: Contains soy and ingredients that may contain gluten
Ingredients
6 cups vegetable broth
1 cup thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms
½ pound firm tofu, drained and rinsed
½ cup bamboo shoots, cut into thin strips
½ cup tamari or soy sauce, plus more to taste
5 Tbsps distilled white vinegar (or rice vinegar)
½ tsp granulated sugar
4-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated, about 2 Tbsps
1 tsp salt
¼ tsp garlic powder
1 tsp ground cayenne pepper
1 tsp ground white pepper
2 Tbsps cornstarch
½ cup water
2 Tbsps scallions, finely chopped, about ¼ cup
1 tsp toasted sesame oil
1.
2.
Directions.
Bring the broth to a boil in a large pot. Add the mushrooms, tofu,
bamboo shoots, ½ cup tamari, vinegar, sugar, ginger, salt, garlic
powder, cayenne pepper, and white pepper. Simmer for 15 to 20
minutes. Taste and add more tamari if desired.
Make a slurry with the cornstarch by mixing it in a small bowl with
the water. Add the slurry to the pot slowly, stirring constantly. Cook
for another 2 to 3 minutes so the cornstarch can thicken the soup.
Ladle the soup into bowls, and serve garnished with scallions and a
drizzle of toasted sesame oil.
toveto Whit Bea Cassoule
MAKES 6 TO 8 SERVINGS
Chef Sara: Traditional cassoulet is a slow-cooked French specialty typically containing several types
of meat and white beans. In our vegan version, the beans take center stage, and the cooking happens
on the stovetop instead of the oven. The finished stew is rich with fresh herbs, chunks of vegetables,
and tender beans. Toasted breadcrumbs add crunch to each piping hot bowl of stew.
Allergens: Contains gluten
Special Equipment: Food processor
Tip: For additional texture and flavor, you can stir in sliced vegan sausages during the
last 5 minutes of cooking.

BREAKING THE RULES
In 2018, we discovered that our supporters actually love to squish around in
the mud with pigs, tiptoe through the coolness of the main barn in order not
to wake Hannah, our elderly blind sheep, and step into the turkey barn to
feel what we mean when we say, “You’re about to have an experience
you’ll remember for the rest of your lives.” I lead these aptly named “Break
All the Rules” tours, and it’s a toss-up as to who enjoys them more: the
guests, the animals, or me.
The weather, which of the animals are most accessible, the composition
of the group, and the personality and energy level of its members: these
things and more make each “Break All the Rules Tour” entirely unique.
Group dynamics help inform whether we climb fences or open gates, sit in
a semi-circle surrounding giant Tucker or stand a respectful distance, have a
full-out love-fest with the pigs versus me being the only one doing all the
pig kissing.
In general, though, these unconventional tours lean heavily toward lovefests. We focus on the animals who crave affection and who give back as
much or more love than is offered them. Tucker’s head droops and his eyes
blink slowly as he accepts gentle scratches on his cheeks, forehead, neck,
and shoulders. Jasmine the pig stares without guile into the souls of those
who sit in front of her. Turkeys Michael and Imogen nestle fully into the
laps of unsuspecting guests, who typically sit silently, tears rolling down
their cheeks, often uttering a sentence that begins with “I had no idea . . .”
“Yes,” I say. “Turkeys are love on two legs.”
Catskill Animal Sanctuary tours change lives. We speak the truth,
always with love, about the urgency of veganism, not only for the animals,
not only for our precious planet, but also for our very survival. But it’s the
animals—these precious animals with their glorious individuality, their
capacity to forgive, their breathtaking full-heartedness—who speak with a
clarity that simply cannot be misunderstood. Ninety-three percent of our
non-vegan guests say they intend to reduce or eliminate animal products
from their diet as a result of visiting Catskill Animal Sanctuary. We have
Tucker, Jasmine, Michael, and so many more to thank for that.
And just like our tours changes lives, so do our recipes. Whether you’re feeling
famished or peckish, our sides and salads will satisfy all kinds of appetites and all
kinds of eaters. From Chickpea Waldorf Salad (pg. 86) to Stovetop Mac and Cheese
(p. 105), these dishes can play a supporting or starring role—you decide.

Chef Linda: Whatever the reason, whether it be taste, comfort, or ease, it seems eggs and dairy are
the most challenging foods to eliminate from our diets. Thankfully, it’s easier than ever to live
happily without them. When we make this eggless egg salad for visitors and summer campers at
Catskill Animal Sanctuary, we prove it with every bite. Tofu takes on the familiar flavor of this
family favorite, while turmeric gives it a sunny, yellow hue. Sulphur-scented black salt adds the
authentic taste and smell of eggs. Enjoy this creamy, comforting salad on top of fresh greens, stuffed
in a pita, rolled up in a wrap, or on your favorite crackers.

Chef Linda: When Oscar Tschirky, the mâitre d’hôtel of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, developed his
acclaimed salad recipe in 1896 for a charity ball, dairy-free yogurt and egg-free mayonnaise probably
didn’t exist. If they had, his recipe surely would have been vegan. Created as a fruit and nut salad,
ours takes it a step further with the addition of chickpeas. Crunchy and tender, sweet and salty—all at
the same time—this salad begs you to slow down and savor each bite. Serve on a bed of crisp salad
greens or tuck it into a pita pocket with peppery sprouts. We originally created this sweet, playful
salad for children attending our summer camp, but quickly noticed that the adults liked it just as
much by the way they gobbled it up at our food demonstrations.

SERVES 8 TO 10
Chef Linda: We created this tasty orzo salad to showcase the flavors of Mediterranean food and
introduce guests to feta cheese made with tofu. Briny and lemony, colorful and vibrant, this
combination of common ingredients creates a distinctive salad that’s perfect for a weeknight dinner
but festive enough for entertaining. The tofu is marinated in a salty, pungent paste and baked to
intensify the flavors. You can make this dish without the tofu feta, but then you’d miss out on the
creamy, salty chunks! The directions call for making the dressing in a food processor or, but you can
chop ingredients with a knife for a chunkier effect.
Allergens: Contains soy
Special Equipment: Food processor or blender
Make Ahead: Make tofu feta 1 or 2 days in advance.
Ingredients
Tofu Feta
1 (14- to 16-ounce) package of firm or extra-firm tofu

½ cup fresh lemon juice
1 cup capers, drained
⅓ cup sun-dried tomatoes, dry- or oil-packed, chopped
2 large cloves garlic, peeled
2 medium shallots, peeled
Freshly ground black pepper
½ tsp salt
Directions
Drain, raise, and press the tofu (see pg. 6).
To make the tofu feta, stir together the ingredients except the tofu in a
large bowl. Cut tofu into 1-inch cubes. Add to the bowl and stir to
coat. The tofu will be more flavorful if left to marinade for several
hours or overnight, but proceed if time does not allow.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Arrange tofu in a single layer on a baking tray
lined with parchment. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until cubes turn
light brown. Set aside to cool.
To make the salad, cook orzo according to package directions. Rinse
with cold water, drain, and empty into a large bowl. Stir in chickpeas,
tomatoes, olives, artichoke hearts, and basil.
To make the dressing, place all of the ingredients, except for the salt,
in a food processor and pulse into a chunky blend; do not purée. Taste
and add more salt and lemon juice if desired. Dressing should have a
strong flavor so that it stands up to the orzo. Pour dressing over orzo
and toss to combine. Add tofu feta and toss again. Serve immediately

and cherry tomatoes are a tasty contrast to the salty olives and tofu feta, and a modest but lovely
dressing coaxes out the season’s best flavors. This recipe was developed to showcase tofu feta in our
popular Compassionate Cuisine vegan cheese class. It may seem like an unusual combination of
flavors, but we’ve never had leftovers!
Allergens: Contains soy and ingredients that may contain gluten
Make Ahead: Make tofu feta 1 or 2 days in advance for easy assembly.
Ingredients
Tofu Feta
1 (14- to 16-ounce) package of firm tofu
3 Tbsps mellow white miso
3 Tbsps nutritional yeast
3 Tbsps fresh lemon juice
2 Tbsps extra-virgin olive oil
1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp salt
Salad
3 heaping cups of cubed 1-inch-piece watermelon
2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
1 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded, halved lengthwise and sliced
1 small red onion, thinly sliced, about ½ cup
⅓ cup pitted kalamata olives, roughly chopped
1½ cups tofu feta

½ cup fresh parsley, mint, or basil, roughly chopped
3 Tbsps extra-virgin olive
3 Tbsps fresh lemon juice
Coarse salt, to taste
Ground black pepper, to taste
Directions
Drain, rinse, and press tofu (see pg. 6).
To make the tofu feta, prepare marinade paste by stirring together
remaining ingredients in a large bowl. Cut tofu into 1-inch cubes and
add to the bowl. Stir to gently to coat tofu. Result will be more
flavorful if it’s left to marinade for several hours or overnight, but
proceed to baking if time does not allow.
Preheat oven to 350°F. Arrange tofu in a single layer on a baking tray
lined with parchment. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until cubes start
to turn light brown. Remove from oven and let cool completely or
refrigerate.
To assemble the salad, gently toss together in a large bowl the
watermelon, tomatoes, cucumber, onion, olives, tofu feta, and fresh
herbs. Drizzle with the olive oil and add lemon juice. Sprinkle with
pinch of salt and pepper. Toss again and serve chilled. Salad is best
eaten the same day it’s made.

SERVES 8 TO 10
Chef Linda: Italian immigrant and restaurateur, Caesar Cardini, is said to have invented a tasty salad
made with the remaining ingredients left in his kitchen after a Fourth of July rush depleted his
supplies. Originally, Caesar salad included anchovies, coddled eggs, and parmesan. Apologies, Mr.
Cardini, you won’t find those ingredients in our kitchen. In our version, adored by staff and guests at
the Sanctuary, kale takes center stage because of its nutritional content, color, and curly leaves that
cradle the luscious dressing. Capers, miso, and kelp granules provide the briny-salty punch in place
of the anchovies. We used polenta to make the croutons to put a tasty spin on something familiar (and
to make it gluten-free), but use cubed bread if you prefer.
Allergens: Contains nuts, soy, and ingredients that may contain gluten
Special Equipment: Food processor or blender
Make Ahead: Nut parmesan and dressing can be made 2 to 3 days in advance
Tip: Find kelp granules in the ethnic aisle of well-stocked grocery stores. You can also
substitute with dulse flakes or ½ sheet of nori paper, crumbled into tiny pieces.
Ingredients
Polenta Croutons
1 (18-ounce) tube of pre-made polenta, cut into ½-inch cubes
2 Tbsps olive oil
½ cup nutritional yeast
1 Tbsp onion powder
1 Tbsp garlic powder
½ tsp salt
Nut Parmesan
1 cup unsalted nuts (walnuts, almonds, or Brazil nuts)
⅓ cup nutritional yeast
2 medium cloves garlic, peeled, plus more to taste

¼ tsp salt, plus more to taste
Dressing
1 cup raw cashews, soaked in water for 30 minutes, drained
4 large cloves garlic, peeled
4 Tbsps extra virgin olive oil
3 Tbsps fresh lemon juice
2 Tbsps white or yellow miso
2 Tbsps Dijon mustard
2 Tbsps kelp granules
2 Tbsps capers, drained
½ cup water
Salad
1 bunch kale, stems removed and torn or cut into small, small bite-sized pieces, about 5–6 cups
1 head of romaine lettuce, chopped into small bite-sized pieces, about 4 cups
Directions
To make polenta croutons, preheat oven to 425°F. Line a baking tray
with parchment. Place cubed polenta in a large bowl and toss with the
olive oil. Add nutritional yeast, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt.
Toss to coat. Arrange polenta in a single layer on the baking tray and
roast for 15 to 20 minutes stirring midway through baking. The
croutons are done when the sides are golden brown.
To make the nut parmesan, place all the ingredients in a food
processor and pulse until mixture resembles coarse sand. Taste and
adjust seasonings, adding more salt or garlic, if you choose.
To make the dressing, place all the ingredients in a blender and blend
until smooth. Add more water to thin, if necessary, 1 tablespoon at a
time. Dressing should taste very strong. It will mellow when the salad
is assembled.
To assemble the salad, place kale and romaine in a large bowl. Add
the desired amount of dressing and toss to combine. Store leftover
dressing in a covered container for up to one week. Top salad with
polenta croutons and sprinkle with nut parmesan. Store leftover
parmesan in the refrigerator for several weeks or freeze.

colors, bright flavors, and interesting textures. Hearts of palm, which are the tender, inner trunks of
young palm tree trunks planted and replanted to harvest as food, can be found in most grocery stores.
This salad is a delightful combination of both crunchy and soft textures with a light and lemony

Chef Linda: Nutty-tasting quinoa, a seed related to spinach (yes, really!), has become the ubiquitous
staple for vegans. Quinoa is not only versatile and quick-cooking, but it also makes an excellent and
compassionate protein choice. Perfect for potlucks or lunch boxes, this recipe is fuss-free, flavorful,
and fun to eat. Zesty with lime and crushed red pepper flakes, you can adjust the flavors by adding
them a little at time until it tastes just right. Roasted and salted pumpkin (or sunflower) seeds add a
burst of saltiness and crunch, but use raw if you prefer. This salad is forgiving and flexible.
Make Ahead: Quinoa can be made 2 to 3 days in advance for easy assembly.
Tip: For simplicity, we recommend frozen corn, but use fresh when it’s in season. Cut
the kernels from the cob and add them raw or use leftover from corn on the cob.
Ingredients
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
1¾ cups water
1½ tsps salt, divided
⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil
⅓ cup fresh lime juice, from 3–4 limes
1 Tbsp maple syrup
½–1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, depending on spice level
½ tsp ground cumin
1 (15.5-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed (or 1½ cups cooked)
1 (15.5-ounce) can red or white kidney beans, drained and rinsed (or 1½ cups cooked)

Bring quinoa, water, and 1 teaspoon of salt to a boil in a medium pot.
Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, but still
has a little bite to it and the liquid has been absorbed, about 15
minutes.
In a large bowl, whisk together oil, lime juice, syrup, crushed red
pepper flakes, cumin, and remaining ½ teaspoon of salt. Add beans,
corn, cilantro, and scallions. Empty quinoa into the bowl with the
beans and dressing. Toss to combine. Garnish with pepitas or

Chef Linda: Like a simple black dress, everyone should have a go-to coleslaw recipe. When you do,
you’ll find yourself using it with burgers, BBQ, and just about anything that welcomes its bright,
tangy flavor and crisp texture. This version works well in a team because it doesn’t go overboard
with its own flavors, but rather plays a supporting role to more dominant flavors. Make it once or
twice, and you’ll have it memorized for life.
Tip: Cabbage has lots of water and can dilute the taste of the best dressings. Put the
cabbage in a bowl and sprinkle with a little salt about 1 hour before making the
coleslaw. Toss and keep it in the refrigerator. Drain excess water before using.
Ingredients
1½ tsps salt
¼ cup apple cider vinegar
¼ cup maple syrup
¼ cup olive oil
1 Tbsp yellow mustard
1 tsp celery seed
Ground black pepper, to taste
1 (10- to 16- ounce) package shredded cabbage, or 1 small head of red or green cabbage, thinly
shredded
Directions
In a small bowl, mix together all ingredients except the cabbage. Pour
the dressing over the cabbage and toss to coat evenly. Taste and adjust
seasonings. Chill for 30 minutes, then toss again and serve.

Chef Linda: We eat with our eyes first, which is why food should beckon and tempt—and this salad
does all of that and more. Legend tells us that black rice was referred to as “forbidden” because it
was once eaten exclusively by the emperors of China to enrich health and ensure longevity.
Thankfully, we can all enjoy the taste, beauty, and health benefits of black rice today. This heirloom
rice is treasured for its delicious roasted, nutty taste and beautiful deep-purple color. The addition of
vibrant-green edamame beans and toasted pistachios add to the visual appeal and complement the
nutritional value of the rice. Enjoy this salad as a side dish or a complete meal—good for a
weeknight dinner but also impressive enough for entertaining.
Allergens: Contains nuts, soy, and ingredients that may contain gluten
Make Ahead: Shiitake crisps can be made 1 day in advance and stored in a sealed
container in the refrigerator.
Ingredients
¾ cup black rice
½ tsp salt

To Assemble
½ cup shelled, salted pistachios
2 scallions, thinly sliced, about ¼ cup
Directions
Bring 3½ cups water to a boil. Add rice and salt. Reduce heat, cover,
and simmer for about 15 minutes. Add quinoa. Stir and cover again.
Cook for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until the rice and quinoa are
tender. Drain excess water and empty into a very large bowl or onto a
baking tray to cool.
While the rice and quinoa are cooking, cook edamame according to
package instructions. Drain and rinse in cold water. Avoid
overcooking edamame or it will result in a dull green color instead of
bright green.
To make the shiitake crisps, preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray
with parchment. Place sliced mushrooms in a mound on the baking
tray. Drizzle with the oil. Toss to coat and arrange in a single layer.
Sprinkle with salt and paprika. Roast for about 25 minutes, stopping
to stir about halfway through cooking time. Mushrooms are done
when they are dark brown, almost burnt. Transfer to a paper towel–
lined plate to cool.
While rice, quinoa, and mushrooms are cooking, make the vinaigrette
by whisking lime juice, vinegar, tamari, olive oil, toasted sesame oil,
syrup, and ginger together in a large bowl. Taste and adjust with salt
or more lime juice.
Add the cooled rice and quinoa, edamame, pistachios, and scallions to
the bowl with the dressing. Toss to combine. Serve immediately,
topped with shiitake crisps, or chill before serving.

compassionate dish when you leave out eggs and animal protein. This vegan version, developed for
our Compassionate Cuisine Asian cooking class “Better Than Takeout,” is the perfect dish for when
you have leftover rice. Seasoned scrambled tofu replaces the eggs and contributes plant-based protein

Chef Linda: Blistered and adorned with buttery leeks and roasted shiitake, these aren’t your average
green beans. Bringing out the best in each other, the ingredients harmonize to create a flavorful,
textured savory dish. The green beans are cooked quickly on high heat—the charred taste adds a
smokiness that marries beautifully with a mess of sautéed leeks and garlic. A hearty splash of
balsamic and maple syrup add lively notes. These green beans are simple enough for weeknights and
sublime for special occasions.

Sprinkle with salt and paprika. Roast for about 25 minutes, stopping
to stir about halfway through cooking time. Mushrooms are done
when they are dark brown, almost burnt. Transfer to a paper towel–
lined plate to cool.
To make the green beans, heat oil over medium- high in a large (12-
inch) frying pan; cast iron works very well. Let the oil get hot enough
so that a green bean sizzles when added. Working in batches, add
enough green beans to cover the bottom of the pan. Let them cook for
a several minutes without stirring so that they blacken and blister a
little. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 8 minutes, until green
beans are partly charred and mostly crisp, but a little tender to the bite.
Transfer green beans to a plate and repeat until all the green beans are
cooked.
Add the leeks, garlic, and salt to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally,
until the leeks are softened and translucent, another 5 minutes. Return
all the green beans to the pan and stir in balsamic, syrup, and black
pepper. Serve immediately with shiitake crisps on top.

Chef Linda: For many people considering a plant-based diet, it’s not the meat but the cheese they
can’t imagine living without. Well, we’ll let you in on a little secret . . . you don’t have to live without
it! Take this mac and cheese recipe—it’s simple and economical, and it uses everyday ingredients, so
you can dig into this creamy family-favorite anytime you want. Our approach is deceptively
delicious: carrots, potatoes, and chickpeas are blended to silky-smooth perfection, and, together with
few additional ingredients, they create a sauce that is undeniably cheesy. This dish is so good you
may want to make it when the kids are not around. We encourage you to make extra sauce and eat it
with broccoli, or baked potatoes, or your fingers . . .
Allergens: Contains ingredients that may contain gluten and soy. Nut parmesan

To make the cheese sauce, place carrots, potatoes, onion, garlic, and
butter in a small pot and cover with milk. Simmer until the vegetables
are soft, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully pour into
the blender. Add the chickpeas, nutritional yeast, lemon juice,
mustard, turmeric, and salt. Do not blend right away. Let the mixture
cool while you start the macaroni.
Boil the macaroni in salted water, according to package directions.
Blend the cheese sauce for about 1½ minutes, until smooth and
glossy. Taste and add more salt or lemon juice if you like.
To make the nut parmesan, put all of the ingredients in a food
processor and pulse until finely ground.
When the pasta is done, drain and return it to the pot. Add most of the
cheese sauce and stir to combine. It will seem very saucy, but the
pasta will absorb the sauce as it sits. Serve immediately, drizzled with
additional sauce and garnished with nut parmesan. Store the
remaining nut parmesan in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up
to one month. Extra sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for up to
five days or frozen for up to six months.

Spice Cabbag an Cauliflowe
SERVES 4 TO 6
Chef Linda: In this Indian-inspired recipe, we use two vegetables that belong together, especially
when combined with rich, warming spices—cabbage and cauliflower. Together, they create a lovely
blank canvas to absorb rich flavors, while standing up in their own right. Garam masala, a common
Indian blend of spices, boasts a warm, sweet flavor that transforms these ordinary vegetables into a
magical experience. Garam refers to the intensity and heat of the spices, though it doesn’t necessarily
mean spicy, and masala is a term used for a mixture of spices. Served over rice or your favorite
cooked whole grain, this humble dish is surprisingly addictive. In our Compassionate Cuisine Indian
food class, we add a generous dollop of Cashew Sour Cream (pg. 188) to add a creamy, satisfying
finish.
Ingredients
1 Tbsp coconut oil
1 tsp cumin seed
1 tsp mustard seeds
2 tsps garam masala
¼ tsp crushed red pepper flakes
2-inch piece of fresh ginger, grated, about 1 Tbsp
3 large cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp
1 head cauliflower, about 1½ pounds, cut into florets, about 6 cups
1 red bell pepper, seeded and sliced into thin strips, about 1 cup
1 medium head of cabbage, about 1½ pounds, very thinly sliced, about 6 cups
2 Tbsps fresh lemon juice
1½ tsps salt
Chopped cilantro, for garnish
Directions
Heat the oil in a large, deep pan or pot over medium heat. Add the
cumin and mustard seeds, garam masala, crushed red pepper flakes,
2.
ginger, and garlic. Cook while stirring, for a minute or two, until
fragrant. Add cauliflower as the bottom layer, then pepper strips, then
cabbage, sprinkling a little salt on each layer as you go. Cover tightly
and cook for about 25 minutes. Tightly covering the pot creates steam
which helps to cooks the vegetables through.
When done, the cabbage and cauliflower should be tender, but not
mushy. Check the texture about midway through cooking. Add lemon
juice then toss gently in the pan and taste. Adjust seasonings if
necessary, adding more heat or salt. Transfer to a serving platter and
sprinkle with chopped cilantro.

Cauliflower can also serve as a lower-carb substitute for rice. All you need is a food grater or food
processor to turn a head of cauliflower into a heaping bowl of “rice.” In this recipe, you’ll get the
comforting texture and “south of the border” flavors without overdoing the carbs on your plate.

When cooked, it retains a pleasant, slightly chewy texture that holds up beautifully in soups, salads,
and side dishes. In this recipe, we’ve paired farro with flavorful mushrooms, pecans, dried
cranberries, and fresh herbs to make a delicious and elegant pilaf, perfect for the holiday season.
Allergens: Contains gluten and nuts
Make Ahead: Farro can be cooked 1 or 2 days in advance.
Tip: Oyster mushrooms are our favorite here, but feel free to substitute cremini,
portobello, or even white button mushrooms.

Combine the farro and water in a large pot. Bring to a boil over
medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and allow to
simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, until the farro is tender but not mushy.
Drain excess water and set the farro aside.
Heat the oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and
cook until softened and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the
mushrooms and garlic, and cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes, until
the mushrooms have released their liquid and the garlic is fragrant.
Pour in the wine and allow it to bubble and reduce for another minute
or so, scraping up any flavorful bits from the bottom of the pan. Add
the salt, cooked farro, cranberries, pecans, fresh herbs, and a few
grinds of black pepper, and mix well. Taste, adjust seasonings as
desired, and serve. The pilaf will keep in the refrigerator for up to five
days.

ON LOVE, LOSS, AND HOT DOGS
When a local fundraiser Go Dog Go was held to support dog rescue efforts,
I was invited to be one of three judges of their “show.” I jumped at the
opportunity—there was fun to be had.
I was in the company of Bruce Littlefield, bestselling author and
“arbiter of fun,” and Pia Salk, a psychologist, animal lover, and live wire.
Judging spackle would have been fun with these two, but when you add the
fact that the divisions of this “dog show” were “Bad Hair Day,” “Most
Mysterious Heritage,” “I Look Like My Mama,” and so on, and that dog
kisses were available on demand, well . . . the day was custom made for me.
In fact, Go Dog Go is the only kind of dog show I could ever support.
While Go Dog Go would have been my idea of a good time anytime, on
this day, it was especially meaningful after a tough week of saying goodbye
to my beloved Babe, a seventeen-year-old steer who touched thousands of
lives at Catskill Animal Sanctuary and whom I loved every bit as much as I
love The Great Dog Chumbley, who sleeps at the foot of my bed every
night. If ever there was a big, hairy ball of lovableness, it was Babe.
Babe, all 1,800-ish pounds of him, arrived at Catskill Animal Sanctuary
in 2003. We were a fledgling organization . . . and we looked it. We had just
purchased our property, a forlorn, forgotten farm that needed rescuing every
bit as much as the animals who would soon arrive, when big Babe barreled
down the drive.
Babe’s human friend had rescued him at an auction, wanting to save one
life. She’d bottle-fed him, kept him in her backyard until he simply grew
too big, then boarded him, rather ironically, at a beef farm. When she
divorced, she could no longer afford his board, and the farmer gave her a
month to find him a home. Fortunately for Babe, and fortunately for us, his
human found Catskill Animal Sanctuary.
I am flooded with memories of the placid being with the soft eyes and
the tongue that reached out expertly to grab one carrot, then another, and
then another until a five-pound bag was gobbled up.
Among my favorite memories:
BABE THE HOMEBODY
I’m not sure why—maybe our fencing didn’t stand a chance against our
new “moose”—but for a short while, Babe was a free-ranger. Only he never
went anywhere. Free to roam the entire farm, Babe instead stood in the
middle of the barn aisle, motionless as Peepers the duck patrolled the barn
by waddling frantically back and forth under Babe’s belly. “QuackQUACK!!” Peepers said, rushing under the black giant, who stood unfazed
as he eyed the feed room. Surrounded by free-ranging ducks, chickens,
goats, sheep, and a growing human fan club, Babe seemed supremely at
peace.
BABE THE BRUTE
Once, a bunch of us were cleaning the cow field. I stood atop the tractor
bucket to bellow instructions to volunteers who were spread throughout the
large pasture. Babe wandered up to say hello, but got so close that when he
turned his head to flick a fly away, he sent me sailing through the air. I
landed with a thud, gathered my breath, then laughed hysterically. Babe
startled, but then walked over and licked my head.
BABE THE RINGLEADER
6:30 a.m. Two police cars pulled down our driveway. “Are you missing
somebody?” a young cop asked. I remember the wry smile on his face;
somehow I knew that this was code for “Your cows are in town.” And in the
town they were, all right—Babe had led his herd through the woods, down
our local rural lane, and onto the very busy Rt. 9W . . . and then he’d just
stood there. The escapade, and our return walk home (I put a bright green
draft horse halter on Babe and led him down the road while the others
followed) was on the evening news.
BABE THE WISEMAN
Several summers ago, the renowned Omega Institute invited us to bring
animals for their animal communication workshop. We don’t typically
oblige such requests, and have turned down dozens more to provide animals
for school fairs, Nativity scenes, and even a movie shoot in Central Park.
But this felt different. We’d be outside, by the pond, where the animals
could relax, graze, and essentially be loved for a weekend. So we took our
best ambassadors, and our most social friends—the ones we felt would truly
enjoy the experience. Whether or not we learned how to “communicate”
with them (I believe all of us are communicating all the time but am
ambivalent about how “animal communication” is often taught), I wanted
our animal friends to open the hearts of those whose previous experiences
had only included dogs and cats.
I didn’t expect that Babe would want to join us. Like many of us, cows
are frightened of unfamiliar situations. Yet when I opened the trailer door,
he evidently did because he stepped right in and cozied up next to Chester
the horse. That he had absolute trust was remarkable enough. And while
maybe it’s a stretch to say that on some level he knew we needed him, that’s
surely what it felt like.
Throughout the weekend, the communicator guided us through various
relaxation techniques, after which we would open ourselves to the messages
our friends wished to share. I was blown away by our animals’ comfort
level and their obvious connection to their Catskill people (six staff
members had been given the chance to attend the workshop)—how much
we learned from them!
The instructor decided that Babe would be the final animal with whom
we’d practice. This is exactly what happened: we had just finished
“speaking with” our old, hilarious Appaloosa named Chester, who put his
head down to graze in the meadow where we’d gathered. “Let’s turn our
attention now to this big guy,” the teacher said, gesturing toward Babe, and
as she suggested that we form a circle around him, Babe walked right into
the middle. Then, as she’d done with each of the animals, she invited us to
close our eyes. As she spoke softly and we breathed slowly and deeply, my
eyes stayed open, and I watched a huge black head droop. “Relax,” she
whispered, and he did. Babe’s giant head dropped lower, and lower still,
until right before his knees were about to buckle, he folded his legs and lay
down.
And that’s when I received a clear and plaintive and powerful message.
“We don’t want to be hamburger,” is one part I remember, along with: “I
hope I’m doing a good job. Thank you for choosing me.”
To this day, I’m not sure what to make of that moment.
I don’t recall what anyone said about what Babe “communicated” to
them. But I do recall many of them weeping, one woman sitting in front of
him and cradling his massive head as he licked her face, and another
woman draping her body over Babe’s back (after she saw me do it). And I
remember the thought that struck me like a lightning bolt: “These people
will never eat meat again.”
Back to my story: I suppose the organizers of Go Dog Go thought it
would be clever to sell “hot dogs” (and nothing more) at a “dog show.” But
the “hot dogs” were not “hot” (as in cooked) “dogs” (as in the animal) at
all. They were cooked cows. I’m fairly certain that our Babe, and every
other cow or pig who’s ever lived, if given the “Bad Hair Day” or “Become
a Hot Dog” choice, would have chosen the former.
I stood in line behind half a dozen animal lovers, all of whom ordered
cooked cows.
“I’ll have the veggie burrito,” I said to the vendor, who in the eleventh
hour had put them on her menu at my request.
“I have a pet pig,” she said as we chatted briefly about my special
request. “He’s really something.”
“They’re remarkable animals,” I responded. “Are you vegan?”
“Me?” she laughed. “Never. I love my meat.”
Eating vegan does not mean forsaking hearty, meaty foods. Consider a Cuban
Jackfruit Sandwich, crispy and oozing with cheese (pg. 117), a Shepherd’s Pie piled
high with mashed potatoes (pg. 161), or a thick slice of Meatless Meatloaf doused in
gravy (pg. 145). We, too, love our meat—ours just happens to be made from plants.
Mai Meal
Without the hope of something delicious or familiar to hitch our
hunger to, eating vegan might seem elusive. We’ll wish for a
burger piled high with toppings to sink our teeth into. We’ll pine
for meatballs smothered in sauce. And the day will come when
nothing short of creamy fettuccine will tame our passions. Luckily,
eating vegan doesn’t mean foregoing any of these. These main
meals have been created to soothe and gratify, to delight and
surprise, and to reassure us that choosing compassion eliminates
only the suffering, not the satisfaction.

SERVES 4 TO 6
Chef Linda: For some, the Sloppy Joe is a bad memory—an oily, mysterious, loose meat sandwich
served in school cafeterias. Thanks to the humble lentil, this version gets a scrumptious, meat-free
makeover. Cooked right, lentils are tender with a just a little bite. But texture is only half of the
equation. Sloppy Joes have a distinct flavor: sweet, sour, and tangy—a playful cross between tomato
sauce and BBQ sauce. To achieve it, we use vinegar, mustard, syrup, and, yes, molasses! Add your
favorite hot sauce for a spicy kick. Your Sloppy Joe won’t be truly complete unless it’s served on a
lightly toasted bun with a “schmear” of vegan butter and a side of potato chips to scoop up what will
inevitably fall out.
Allergens: Contains ingredients that may contain gluten
Make Ahead: Lentils can be cooked several days in advance.
Tip: Worcestershire sauce traditionally includes anchovies to give it a salty punch, so
look for a vegan version in the aisle with BBQ sauce. Use it to add a tangy zing to
dressings and sauces.
Ingredients
1 cup lentils
2 tsps salt, divided
2 Tbsps olive oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped, about 1 cup
1 large red bell pepper, chopped in ¼-inch pieces, about 1 cup
3 cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp
1 cup water
2 Tbsps tomato paste
2 Tbsps ketchup
2 Tbsps maple syrup or brown sugar
2 Tbsps apple cider vinegar
1 Tbsp vegan Worcestershire sauce
1 Tbsp yellow mustard
1.
2.
3.
1 Tbsp molasses
1½ tsps smoked paprika
1 tsp chili powder
To Serve
Soft buns or rolls
Vegan butter
Potato chips
Dill pickles
Directions
Pick over the lentils, discarding any withered ones or stones. Place in
a medium saucepan, cover generously with water, add 1 teaspoon of
salt and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 20
minutes, until tender. Avoid overcooking. Drain and set aside.
Heat oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion, bell
pepper, garlic, and the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring
occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Add
the water, tomato paste, ketchup, syrup, vinegar, Worcestershire
sauce, mustard, molasses, smoked paprika, and chili powder. Lower
heat to medium and simmer for about 10 minutes more, until sauce
has thickened.
Remove pan from heat. Lightly toast buns and spread with vegan
butter. Place buns on plates and spoon lentil mixture on top. Serve
with potato chips and pickles.
Cuba Jackfrui Sandwiche
MAKES 4 SANDWICHES
Chef Linda: A variation of a ham and cheese sandwich that includes roast pork, the Cuban sandwich
was a common lunch for workers in the cigar factories and sugar mills in Cuba. It’s made with crispy
bread, pressed on a grill top, and held fast with oozing cheese and tangy pickles. We just had to
remake this classic with compassion, and jackfruit fit the bill to take the place of the pork. A zesty
marinade perks up this versatile, canned fruit. We like roasting the jackfruit—we think it deepens the
flavors—but fry it in a pan if you prefer. Vegan sliced cheese is essential to the gooey, scrumptious
texture of this sandwich—thank goodness there are so many brands to choose from! Complete this
compassionate remake with a good “schmear” of spicy mustard and a crisp dill pickle.
Allergens: Contains gluten and ingredients that may contain soy
Special Equipment: Food processor recommended
Ingredients
¼ cup orange juice
¼ cup lime juice
¼ cup vegan mayonnaise
3 Tbsps maple syrup
2 Tbsps tamari or soy sauce
3 large cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp
1 Tbsp chopped cilantro, optional
2 tsps onion powder
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp salt
Ground black pepper, to taste
2 (20-ounce) cans jackfruit in brine, drained and rinsed
To Assemble
4 Cuban rolls (or a large baguette or crusty sandwich rolls)
Yellow mustard
1.
2.
3.
8 slices of your favorite vegan sliced cheese
8 slices of vegan ham (optional)
Dill pickles slices
2 Tbsps vegan butter
Directions
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray with parchment.
To make the marinade, in a large bowl, whisk together orange juice,
lime juice, mayonnaise, syrup, tamari, garlic, cilantro, onion powder,
cumin, salt, and pepper. Use a food processor to chop the jackfruit.
Alternatively, chop the jackfruit with a sharp knife. You may have to
cut out hard centers of the jackfruit pieces and discard before
chopping. Add chopped jackfruit to the bowl with the marinade. Mix
well. Spread the jackfruit on the lined baking tray and bake for about
30 minutes until edges start to brown slightly.
To assemble the sandwiches, split the bread and spread mustard
liberally on both sides. Place one slice of cheese on the top of the roll
and one on the bottom, then layer the sandwich with ham, pickles, and
jackfruit in between. To cook, melt butter in a large pan (cast iron
works well) over medium heat. Depending on the size of your pan,
place one or two sandwiches in the pan and top with another heavy
pan or pot, then put something heavy in the top pan or pot to help
press the sandwiches down as they cook; canned beans or tomatoes
work well. Sandwiches should be pressed to about half their original
thickness. Cook for about 5 minutes per side, pressing down
occasionally, until the sandwiches have flattened, the bread is toasted,
and the cheese has melted. Alternatively, use an electric panini grill.
Cut in half and serve immediately.

MAKES 6 TO 8 BURRITOS
Chef Linda: Sassy and sweet, this dish was a hands-down favorite in our Compassionate Cuisine
“Budget-Friendly Vegan Meals” class. Shattering the myth that eating vegan is costly and difficult,
this is just one of many recipes made from easy-to-find, economical ingredients. And unlike many
burritos, they boast healthy ingredients. Plus, they taste great! Maybe it’s the combination of gently
spiced roasted sweet potatoes and earthy salsa black beans. Or it could be the luscious cashew herb
cream on top. We can’t decide, because we think that this whole is definitely greater than the sum of
its parts!
Allergens: Contains gluten and nuts
Special equipment: Blender
Ingredients
Sweet Potatoes
2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into ½ -inch cubes, about 3 cups
1 red bell pepper, chopped into ¼-inch pieces, about 1 cup
½ medium onion, finely chopped, about ½ cup
2 Tbsps oil
1 Tbsp chili powder
½ tsp ground cumin
½ tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp ground cayenne pepper
Black Beans
2 (15.5-ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed
¾ cup jarred salsa, divided
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
½ tsp salt
To Assemble
6–8 large (10-inch) tortillas
2 ripe avocados, pitted and sliced
1 batch Cashew Herb Cream (pg. 189)
Chopped cilantro or parsley, for garnish
Directions
Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Lightly oil
a 9-inch square baking dish and set aside.
To make the sweet potatoes, place them along with the bell pepper
and onion on the baking tray in a pile. Drizzle with the oil. Sprinkle
with chili powder, cumin, cinnamon, salt, and cayenne. Use your
hands to toss together, coating everything with spices and oil. Arrange
in a single layer. Place the tray in oven and roast for about 20 minutes,
or until sweet potatoes are fork-tender, but not mushy, and the bell
peppers and onions are tender. When done, remove from oven and
reduce temperature to 375°F.
To make the black beans, place them in a bowl with ½ cup of salsa
and salt. Use a wooden spoon or fork to mash the beans and the salsa
together so that you end up with a spreadable filling.
To assemble, lay a tortilla flat on a cutting board. Spread about ¼ cup
of black bean–salsa mixture on the tortilla, leaving a ¼-inch border.
Arrange ⅓ to ½ cup of sweet potato mixture evenly over the black
beans about a third of the way up from the bottom edge closest to you.
Lay 2 to 3 slices of avocado across the sweet potatoes. Using a firm
hand, begin rolling away from you, while folding and tucking the ends
in. Place burritos seam side down in the prepared baking dish and
repeat until ingredients have been used.
Spoon about half of the cashew-herb cream over burritos. Place the
baking dish in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes, to heat
through. Serve immediately, garnished with the remaining half of the
cashew cream and remaining ¼ cup tomato salsa. Garnish with
cilantro. Alternatively, you can serve without baking.

MAKES 4 LARGE WRAPS
Chef Linda: Do you remember eagerly awaiting lunchtime in grade school? Discovering and
devouring neatly packed sandwiches and treats in our paper bags or lunch boxes was a welcome
break in the day. Bring back the excitement that made you watch the clock so closely by making
yourself one of these wraps! Wholesome white beans and tangy artichoke hearts join forces with
peppery arugula and radishes, cooling cucumber, and creamy avocado. This wrap will give you a
hearty dose of protein, a serving of your daily greens, and the delight in knowing that you are the
envy of the lunch room.
Allergens: Contains gluten
Special Equipment: Food processor
Make Ahead: Shiitake crisps can be made 1 day in advance and stored in a covered
container in the refrigerator.
Ingredients
Shiitake Crisps
4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and very thinly sliced
3 Tbsps olive oil
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp smoked paprika (optional)
Filling
2 (15.5-ounce) cans white beans, drained and rinsed (or 3 cups cooked)
2 cups marinated artichoke hearts, drained
¼ cup sun-dried tomatoes (dry- or oil-packed), chopped
2 Tbsps fresh lemon juice
½ tsp salt
To Assemble
1.
2.
3.
4 cups arugula, lightly chopped
2 small radishes, very thinly sliced
2 Tbsps fresh lemon juice
1 Tbsp olive oil
½ large cucumber, peeled, seeded, and cut lengthwise into thin spears
1 avocado, pitted and cut into thick slices
4 (10-inch) tortillas
Directions
To make the shiitake crisps, preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray
with parchment. Place sliced mushrooms on the baking tray in a pile.
Drizzle with olive oil and mix together with your hands. Arrange in a
single layer and sprinkle with salt and paprika. Roast for about 25
minutes. Mushrooms are done when they are dark brown, almost
burnt. Transfer to a paper towel–lined plate to cool.
To make the filling, place white beans, artichoke, sun-dried tomatoes,
lemon juice, and salt in the food processor. Pulse several times to
combine into a thick, chunky mixture.
To assemble, place the arugula and radishes in a medium bowl.
Drizzle with the lemon juice and oil and toss. Lay tortillas, one at a
time, on a cutting board. Spread about ¾ cup of the white bean
mixture on the tortilla, leaving a ½-inch border. Place arugula over the
bean mixture. Lay 2 cucumber spears and a couple of avocado slices
on the bottom third of each tortilla. Sprinkle shiitake crisps on top.
Roll, while tucking in the ends, into a burrito shape. Cut each wrap in
half, on the diagonal, to serve.
Tempe Reube Sandwic
MAKES 4 SANDWICHES
Chef Linda: The Reuben Sandwich is traditionally made with corned beef, Swiss cheese, and
Russian dressing, and it delivers 40 grams of fat, 1,600 milligrams of sodium, and 770 calories.
Ouch! A more compassionate approach, for you and the animals, is our Tempeh Reuben Sandwich.
Always a favorite at our special events, it’s made with heart-healthy tempeh, avocado, and
sauerkraut, and dressed up with a quick and tasty dressing. Tempeh is often maligned because of its
texture and bitter tones, but if simmered in a little water and soy sauce or tamari, it becomes recipeready! Add a side of fries or a bowl of soup, and this tangy, succulent sandwich will work its way
onto your shortlist of easy favorites.
Allergens: Contains gluten and soy
Ingredients
Tempeh
1 (8-ounce) package of tempeh
1¼ cup water
3 tsps tamari or soy sauce
Marinade
2 Tbsps olive oil
2 Tbsps tamari or soy sauce
2 Tbsps apple cider vinegar
1 Tbsp maple syrup
1 Tbsp yellow mustard
1 tsp liquid smoke (optional)
Dressing
⅓ cup vegan mayonnaise
2 Tbsps capers, rinsed and chopped (or relish)
1.
2.
3.
4.
2 Tbsps ketchup
1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
1 tsp hot sauce or sriracha
To Assemble
8 slices rye bread
1 ripe avocado, pitted and thinly sliced
1 cup sauerkraut, room temperature or hot
Directions
Preheat oven to 375°F. Lay tempeh on cutting board horizontally.
Place your palm on the top of the tempeh and hold while cutting
horizontally, creating two, long, thin cutlets. Keep the two pieces
together and cut it width-wise, in half, then cut each half in half again.
You should end up with 8 cutlets. Place tempeh, water, and tamari in a
small pot over medium heat. Simmer for about 10 minutes. Using a
slotted spoon, gently remove the tempeh cutlets from the pot and
place them on a plate lined with a clean paper towel to dry.
To make the marinade, whisk together the oil, tamari, vinegar, syrup,
mustard, and liquid smoke in a baking dish. Arrange tempeh in a
single layer in the baking dish and spoon marinade over slices to
ensure even coating. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until tempeh is
medium to dark brown. Remove from oven.
To make the dressing, stir together the mayonnaise, capers, ketchup,
lemon juice, and hot sauce.
To assemble the sandwiches, slather 4 pieces of bread with dressing.
Place two tempeh slices each on of the four slices. Top each with a
few slices of avocado and 1 or 2 tablespoons of sauerkraut. Top each
slice of bread with another slice. Cut in half and serve.
BBQ Jackfrui Sandwiche
MAKES 4 TO 6 SANDWICHES
Chef Linda: When brainstorming for Father’s Day recipes, BBQ—and its layers of rich, hearty, and
familiar flavors—was top of mind. Our challenge was to deliver on those worthy expectations while
keeping the meal kind. Luckily, we have jackfruit, the perfect vehicle for all the flavors in a BBQ
sandwich. Cooked first in a delicious marinade, then finished off with traditional BBQ sauce (storebought or homemade, see our recipe on pg. 186), the smoky, spicy scent will surely make your mouth
water and reassure you that compassion is always the best ingredient. For a different spin on nachos,
use this recipe on tortilla chips with your favorite vegan toppings.
Allergens: Contains ingredients that may contain gluten
Special Equipment: Food processor
Ingredients
2 (20-ounce) cans green jackfruit, in water or brine (not syrup)
3 large cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp
2 Tbsps maple syrup
2 Tbsps yellow mustard
2 tsps smoked paprika
2 tsps chili powder
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp salt
1 tsp liquid smoke (optional)
¼–½ tsp cayenne pepper
2 Tbsps olive oil
1 cup store-bought BBQ sauce, plus extra for topping (or use our BBQ sauce recipe on pg. 186)

2.
3.
Directions
Empty jackfruit into a strainer and rinse. Place jackfruit in a food
processor and pulse to chop. You can also chop the jackfruit by hand,
but remove tough center cores first.
In a medium bowl, mix together garlic, syrup, mustard, paprika, chili
powder, cumin, salt, liquid smoke, and cayenne pepper. Add the
jackfruit into the bowl and toss together.
Heat oil in a medium pan over medium heat. Add jackfruit and cook
for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. When the jackfruit is
darkened and somewhat dried out, add the BBQ sauce and stir. Cook
for another 8 to 10 minutes to ensure flavor is distributed throughout.
Serve on buns topped with another dollop of BBQ sauce.

“Cra” Cake wit Remoulad
Sauc
SERVES 4 TO 6 AS A MAIN COURSE
Chef Linda: If your heart swoons for crab cakes in the summer, but you want a more compassionate
solution to your craving, this recipe is a must. There are two options to replace the crab—hearts of
palm, an ingredient found jarred or in cans in most grocery stores; or jackfruit, a tropical fruit most
often purchased in cans. Both have their merits, and both are delicious. We use kelp flakes to add a
bit of briny, seaside taste. Light, crispy, and so flavorful, these compassionate “crab” cakes are
always the hit of the party when we serve them at the Sanctuary. Lovely as an appetizer or main
course served with fries or salad greens.
Allergens: Contains ingredients that may contain soy
Special Equipment: Food processor recommended if using jackfruit
Make Ahead: Mixture can be made 1 day in advance.
Tip: Depending on which brand of canned jackfruit you use, you may have to cut out
the tough core at the center of each piece before chopping by hand.
Ingredients
“Crab” Cakes
1½ cups breadcrumbs, regular or gluten-free, divided
¼ cup vegan mayonnaise, plus 1 heaping Tbsp if using jackfruit
2 Tbsps capers, rinsed and chopped
2 Tbsps fresh lemon juice
2 tsps kelp flakes
1 Tbsp yellow mustard
1 tsp Old Bay Seasoning
½ tsp salt
Ground black pepper, to taste
Dash of cayenne pepper
1.
2.
3.
1 (14- to 16-ounce) jar of hearts of palm, drained, rinsed, and roughly chopped, or 1 (20-ounce) can
of jackfruit in brine, drained and pulsed 2–3 times in a food processor or finely chopped
½ red bell pepper, finely chopped, about ½ cup
2 large celery stalks, finely chopped, about 1 cup
¼ cup minced fresh parsley
1 large shallot, minced, about 3 Tbsps
Assembly
2–3 Tbsps olive oil
1 batch Remoulade Sauce (pg. 186)
Directions
To make the “crab” cakes, measure out ¾ cup of the breadcrumbs into
a shallow dish and set aside. In a medium bowl, stir together the
mayonnaise, capers, lemon juice, kelp flakes, mustard, Old Bay
Seasoning, salt, ground pepper, and cayenne. Add hearts of palm or
jackfruit, bell pepper, celery, parsley, shallots, the remaining ¾ cup of
breadcrumbs, and stir to combine. If using jackfruit, add an extra 1
heaping tablespoons of vegan mayonnaise. Let stand for about 10
minutes to allow the breadcrumbs to bind everything together.
Gently shape “crab” cake mixture into patties, about 3 inches wide
and ½ inch thick. Dredge the patties in breadcrumbs. Heat oil in a
large skillet over medium heat. Fry cakes until golden brown and
crisp, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Alternatively, to bake the cakes,
preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Brush
parchment with oil and arrange cakes on it several inches apart. Bake
for 20 to 25 minutes, carefully flipping midway through.
Serve immediately with a dollop of remoulade sauce on top.
Scarle Blac Bea Burger
MAKES 8 TO 10 BURGERS
Chef Linda: Veggie burgers are a healthy, compassionate way to include variety in your plant-based
diet. Flexibility and creativity are hallmarks of homemade burgers—use what you have on hand,
make substitutions, and let the spices and flavors work for you. The delightfully chunky texture in
this recipe comes from humble whole foods like mushrooms, oats, walnuts, and black beans. Beets
provide earthy flavor and color, and even the most committed beet-haters won’t be able to discern
their flavor while enjoying their wholesome nutrients. Baked in the oven, these burgers are ample,
satisfying, and hold together on a bun or on a bed of salad greens. Serve with Avocado-Scallion
Sauce (pg. 185), and thank us later.
Allergens: Contains nuts and ingredients that may contain gluten and soy
Special Equipment: Food processor
Ingredients
2 Tbsps oil
1 medium beet, peeled and cut into chunks, about 1 cup
2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into large pieces, about 1 cup
½ medium onion, peeled, cut into chunks, about ½ cup
5 ounces button mushrooms, with stems
3 large cloves garlic, peeled
1 cup old-fashioned oats
½ cup walnuts
2 tsps chili powder
2 tsps smoked paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp salt
1 (15.5-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed (or 1½ cups cooked)
½ cup vegan mayonnaise
For Serving
1.
2.
3.
4.
Buns, lettuce, tomato, avocado
1 batch Avocado-Scallion Sauce (pg. 185)
Directions
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Brush oil
on the parchment.
Place beets, carrots, onion, mushrooms, and garlic in the bowl of a
food processor. Pulse until finely chopped. Empty into a large bowl.
Next, place oats, walnuts, chili powder, paprika, cumin, and salt into
the processor and pulse several times, leaving some texture to the nuts
and oats. Empty into bowl with beet mixture. Finally, place beans and
mayonnaise in the processor and pulse to combine, leaving some
texture to the beans. Empty into the bowl with the other ingredients
and mix everything together.
Use a medium portion scoop or ⅓ measuring cup to form each patty.
Use an offset spatula or knife to flatten and create uniform burgers
that are 1½ inches thick and about 3 inches wide. Place burgers on
tray in oven and bake for about 30 minutes. Remove tray from oven
and let burgers sit for about 5 minutes to set.
Serve alone or on buns with all of the fixings—lettuce, tomato,
avocado, and avocado-scallion sauce. Refrigerate extra cooked
burgers for up to five days, or freeze between layers of parchment
paper in a covered container.

SERVES 4 TO 6
Chef Linda: Summer tickles us with the notion that the beach is the place to be. Sandy feet, briny
breezes, and easy living. If you could wrap up that feeling and eat it, you’d have these Seaside
Summer Rolls. Perfect for the beach-blanket lunches or lazy picnics in your backyard, two winning
texture combinations (tender, chunky hearts of palm and chewy mushrooms) make this sandwich
reminiscent of a lobster roll, but without the cruelty. Filling and satisfying, but playfully light, you
might serve these rolls with some chips and and ice-cold lemonade on the side.
Allergens: Contains ingredients that may contain gluten and soy
Tip: If King Oyster mushrooms are hard to come by, substitute shiitake mushroom
caps cut into thick strips.
Ingredients
½ pound King Oyster or trumpet mushrooms
2 Tbsps oil
2 Tbsps vegan mayonnaise
2 Tbsps fresh lemon juice
1½ tsps Old Bay Seasoning

BBQ Tempe Sandwiche
MAKES ABOUT 4 SANDWICHES
Chef Linda: Nothing says summer like the flavors of BBQ. Smoky, tangy, sweet, or hot, there’s
good reason to love anything slathered in BBQ sauce, especially when it’s healthy and
compassionate. Why settle for a store-bought bottle of sauce when you can make your own? Made
mostly with pantry ingredients, this BBQ sauce has a distinct, clean flavor, made with less sugar than
most store-bought versions and no preservatives. You’ll also enjoy the freedom to adjust the flavors
to suit your taste. Tempeh is a wonderful canvas for this sassy sauce and stands up mightily to your
favorite buns and vegan coleslaw—but cauliflower, tofu, or portobello work just as well.
Allergens: Contains soy and ingredients that may contain gluten
Make Ahead: BBQ sauce can be made in advance and stored for up to 3 months.
Tip: Worcestershire sauce typically contains anchovies, so look for a vegan version in
the aisle where you would find BBQ sauce.
Ingredients
1 (8-ounce) package tempeh
1¼ cup water
3 Tbsps tamari or soy sauce
1 batch The Only BBQ Sauce You’ll Ever Need (pg. 186)
To Serve
Buns
Simple, Sweet and Tangy Coleslaw (pg. 97)
Directions
Place tempeh on a cutting board, horizontally. Slice tempeh across
into ¼-inch-wide strips. Place water, tamari, and tempeh in a small

pot. Simmer for about 10 minutes. Transfer tempeh to a plate lined
with a paper towel to dry.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a casserole dish or baking pan with
parchment for easy cleanup. Pour enough BBQ sauce to just cover the
bottom of the casserole dish. Arrange tempeh slices in a single layer
and spoon on a few more tablespoons of BBQ sauce. Spread to cover
each slice.
Place dish in the oven and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes. Tempeh is
done when sauce begins to turn dark brown on top and around the
edges of the pan. Alternatively, line a grill with heavy-duty foil. Coat
tempeh with BBQ sauce and arrange in a single layer over medium
heat, turning once during cooking. Grill for several minutes on each
side. Serve on rolls with coleslaw. Store extra BBQ sauce in a covered
container in the refrigerator for several weeks.

MAKES 6 (3-INCH) BURGERS
Chef Linda: This recipe comes from the Compassionate Cuisine cooking class “Where Will I Get
My Protein?” Tasty recipes made from everyday sources of plant-based protein allow us to easily get
all the healthy proteins we need without harming any animals. Loaded with 15 grams of protein per
serving, these hearty and satisfying burgers also boast generous amounts of calcium, healthy fat, iron,
and fiber. They’re even great on the grill because they hold together so well. Go bun-less for a lighter
meal and serve the burgers on a bed of crisp salad greens dressed with lemon juice. Our AvocadoScallion Sauce (p. 185) adds a boost of nutrition and a vibrant color and bright flavor.
Allergens: Contains nuts, soy, and ingredients that may contain gluten
Special Equipment: Food processor
Tip: Keep the ratios about the same and you can use your favorite nuts and seeds.
For variety, add different spices or herbs and experiment with your favorite dressings.
Ingredients
Burger
2 large cloves garlic, peeled
1 cup raw walnuts or almonds
1 cup ground flaxseed
½ cup hulled hemp seeds
½ cup raw pumpkin seeds
¼ cup balsamic vinegar
3 Tbsps extra-virgin olive oil
2 Tbsps tamari or soy sauce
1 Tbsp nutritional yeast (optional)
To Serve
1.
2.
Fresh salad greens, dressed in oil and lemon juice
Buns, with sliced tomato and avocado
1 batch Avocado-Scallion Sauce (pg. 185)
Directions
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. To make
burgers, pulse garlic in the food processor until finely chopped. Add
walnuts, flaxseed, hemp seeds, and pumpkin seeds. Pulse again until
finely chopped. Add vinegar, oil, tamari, and nutritional yeast, and
pulse again until blended. The mixture should be moist and hold
together when pinched between two fingers. Using a portion scoop or
spoon, form the mixture into 3-inch-wide patties that are about ¾-inch
thick. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until lightly browned on the
bottom, flipping burgers midway through cook time. These burgers
also work well on a grill set at medium heat.
Serve burgers on greens dressed in oil and lemon juice or on buns
with tomato and avocado with a generous dollop of avocado-scallion
sauce.

SERVES 4 TO 6
Chef Linda: This recipe was developed for an Italian cooking class at the Sanctuary and uses
artichoke hearts, cannellini beans, and cashews to create a thick, creamy, and compassionate
alternative to traditional alfredo sauce. It comes together easily in a blender and would be just fine
tossed with your favorite pasta, but we encourage you to make the tomatoes and shiitake crisps to get
the full effect of the complementary flavors, colors, and textures. The tangy pan-roasted tomatoes
burst in your mouth, while shiitake crisps deliver a salty, smoky, crunchy finish. We’ll warn you:
you’ll want to use this sauce everywhere . . . on pasta, with vegetables, or even as a dip for a crusty
loaf of warm bread.
Allergens: Contains nuts
Special Equipment: Blender
Ingredients
Shiitake Crisps
4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and thinly sliced
3 Tbsps olive oil
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp smoked paprika
Pasta
1 pound regular or gluten-free dried fettuccine or pasta
Salt, for the water
Sauce
1 (15.5-ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup marinated artichoke hearts, drained

½ cup raw cashews, soaked in water for 30 minutes, drained
⅓ cup nutritional yeast
2 large cloves garlic, peeled
2 Tbsps extra-virgin olive oil
2 Tbsps fresh lemon juice
¾ tsp salt
Ground black pepper, to taste
Pan-Roasted Tomatoes
1 Tbsp olive oil
2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
¼ tsp coarse salt
3 large cloves garlic, thinly sliced or minced, about 1 Tbsp
Garnish
Chopped parsley
Directions
To make shiitake crisps, preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray
with parchment paper. Place shiitake slices in a mound on the baking
tray and drizzle with oil. Toss to coat with oil. Arrange in a single
layer and sprinkle with salt and paprika. Roast for about 25 minutes,
or until mushrooms are very dark, almost burnt. Remove tray from
oven and let cool. Mushrooms will crisp up as they cool.
Start the pasta by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Meanwhile, make the sauce. Place beans, artichoke hearts, drained
cashews, nutritional yeast, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and
pepper in a blender and purée until velvety and smooth.
While the pasta is cooking, make the pan-roasted tomatoes. Heat oil in
a pan over medium-high heat. Add tomatoes and salt. Cook, stirring
occasionally, for about 5 minutes, or until tomatoes become just soft.
Add garlic and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes.
When pasta is done, drain, reserving about ½ cup of cooking water,
and return to the pot. With the pot over medium heat, add sauce and
toss to combine, adding reserved water to thin to your desired
consistency. Serve pasta in individual bowls or in a large serving
bowl. Top with tomatoes, shiitake crisps, and garnish with parsley.

SERVES 4 TO 6
Chef Linda: Harmony is the combination of musical notes that produce a pleasing effect. The same
can be said for food. When just the right colors, tastes, and textures are combined, there is harmony
in our mouths and bellies. In this recipe, the vibrant-green kale, bright-orange butternut squash, and
pearly white coconut rice are a feast for the eyes. After one bite, you’ll see that these uncomplicated
ingredients hit all the right notes together—salty, sweet, crunchy, and soft. Ahh, music to your
mouth. And don’t be surprised if you break into song when you taste the candied pumpkin seeds.
Tip: When winter squash is unavailable, substitute with sweet potatoes. If you can’t
find the raw, green pumpkin seeds (also called pepitas), use sliced raw sliced almonds
or sunflower seeds.
Ingredients

3 Tbsps maple syrup
2 Tbsps olive oil
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp salt
1 medium (about 2½–3 pounds) butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes, about 4

Greens
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 bunch hearty greens (like kale or chard), about 1 pound, stems removed, chopped or torn into bitesized pieces, about 5–6 cups
3 large cloves garlic, minced or thinly sliced, about 1 Tbsp
¼ tsp salt
Garnish
Toasted coconut chips (optional)
Directions
Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. In a large
bowl, mix together syrup, oil, cinnamon, and salt. Add squash and
pepitas. Toss to coat. Empty contents of bowl onto prepared baking
tray. Place tray in oven and roast for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the
squash is fork-tender, but not mushy. Stir and flip squash midway
through cooking.
While squash is roasting, make the rice. Put water and coconut milk
into a medium pot. Add rice, coconut, and salt. Cover and simmer on
medium-low heat for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until rice is tender.
Remove from heat when done, fluff with a fork, and keep covered.
To make the greens, heat oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat.
Add the chopped greens, garlic, and salt. Cook for about 5 to 7
minutes, while stirring occasionally. Remove from heat when kale is
bright green and wilted.
To serve, scoop rice into a large bowl, top with greens and squash.
Garnish with toasted coconut chips.
Breade Eg plan Cutle Lasagn
SERVES 4 TO 6
Chef Linda: Noodles are nice, but eggplant is better! If you love lasagna but want a new twist on
this beloved comfort dish, use breaded eggplant slices instead of lasagna noodles. We developed this
recipe for a Compassionate Cuisine Italian cooking class to demonstrate that there are plant-based
solutions even to techniques like breading food, which usually involves milk and eggs. The eggplant
is baked to crispy perfection and layered with a tofu ricotta that serves as a compassionate and
healthy alternative to dairy-based ricotta cheese. Delightfully rich, luscious, and creamy, you’ll lose
nothing in terms of taste. This dish is perfect for family dinners or potlucks.
Allergens: Contains soy and ingredients that may contain soy
Make Ahead: Breaded eggplant and tofu ricotta can be made 1 or 2 days in advance
for easy assembly. The entire recipe can be made 1 or 2 days in advance, then
reheated in a 350°F oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Freeze baked lasagna for up to 3
months.
Tip: Enjoy extra cutlets on a roll with lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise.
Ingredients
Breaded Eggplant
2 Tbsps olive oil
¼ cup all-purpose flour or gluten-free flour
½ cup unsweetened nondairy milk
1 cup regular or gluten-free breadcrumbs
1 Tbsp nutritional yeast
½ tsp garlic powder
½ tsp dried oregano
½ tsp dried basil
¼ tsp onion powder
¼ tsp salt
Ground black pepper, to taste

4.
1 large eggplant, about 2 pounds, peeled and sliced into in ⅛-inch-thick round slices (about 12 slices
in total)
Tofu Ricotta
1 (14- to 16-ounce) package of firm tofu, drained, rinsed, and pressed (pg. 6)
¼ cup nutritional yeast
2 Tbsps fresh lemon juice
2 tsps olive oil
2 tsp onion powder
1 tsp garlic powder
½ tsp salt
To Assemble
1 (24- to 32-ounce) jar marinara sauce, or about 3–4 cups homemade sauce
1½ cups shredded vegan mozzarella cheese, divided
Directions
Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Brush or
spread oil on the parchment and set aside.
To make the breaded eggplant, place flour and milk in two separate
bowls. In a third bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, nutritional
yeast, pepper, garlic powder, oregano, basil, onion powder, salt, and
pepper. To bread the eggplant, dredge slices in flour, dip in the milk,
then dredge in breadcrumbs. Place eggplant slices in a single layer on
the baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes then flip each slice and bake for
another 10 minutes, until the eggplant is soft. (The key is cutting
eggplant into thin slices.) Remove from the oven and reduce heat to
375°F.
While eggplant is baking, make the tofu ricotta. Finely crumble the
tofu into a medium bowl. Add nutritional yeast, lemon juice, olive oil,
onion powder, garlic powder, and salt. Mix until all ingredients are
thoroughly combined.
To assemble, lightly oil a 9-inch square baking dish. Spread about ¾
cup of the marinara sauce on the bottom of the dish. Arrange slices of
eggplant over the sauce in order to cover the bottom of the dish.
5.
Spread half the tofu ricotta mixture on top of the eggplant and
sprinkle with ½ cup of mozzarella. Make a second layer by adding
another ¾ cup sauce and arranging eggplant over the sauce. Spread
the remaining half of the tofu ricotta over the eggplant and sprinkle ½
cup of mozzarella, and top with another ¾ cup of sauce. Finish with a
final layer of eggplant, the remaining sauce, and remaining
mozzarella.
Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes, until bubbling around the
sides. Let sit for about 5 minutes to set before cutting and serving.

Peca-Crute Tempe Cutlet
MAKES 8 CUTLETS (4 SERVINGS)
Chef Sara: These festive tempeh cutlets, with their rich pecan coating, make a gorgeous main dish
for your holiday table. We’ve updated the classic breading process by using flaxseed instead of eggs,
and a gluten-free flour blend instead of traditional all-purpose flour (though you can certainly use allpurpose flour). Taking the extra steps to do a three-step breading—seasoned flour, a flax egg, then
pecans—ensures that the pecans won’t fall off the cutlets after they’re baked. Serve with mashed
potatoes, gravy, and cranberry sauce for a simple, delicious holiday feast—no turkey required. You
can also try this recipe using our seitan cutlets (pg. 136).
Allergens: Contains, nuts, soy and ingredients that may contain gluten
Ingredients
2 Tbsps ground flaxseed
½ cup water
1 (8-ounce) package tempeh
1½ cups water, enough to cover the tempeh
3 Tbsps tamari or soy sauce
¼ cup all-purpose or gluten-free flour
1 Tbsp nutritional yeast
1 tsp salt
1 tsp dried thyme
½ tsp dried sage
½ tsp dried marjoram
Ground black pepper, to taste

Preheat the oven to 375°F and line a baking tray with parchment.
Cut the block of tempeh in half horizontally, making two thin planks.
Cut each plank into four triangles or rectangles to yield a total of 8
cutlets. Place the tempeh in small pot with water and tamari. Bring to
a boil, cover, reduce the heat, and allow to simmer for about 10
minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the three-part breading station. Arrange three
wide, shallow bowls on your counter. In one bowl, stir together the
flour, nutritional yeast, salt, thyme, sage, marjoram, and pepper. In the
second bowl, you’ll have the thickened flaxseed mixture. Finally,
place the finely chopped pecans in the third bowl.
Transfer the tempeh from its simmering liquid to a plate and allow to
cool briefly. Dip a cutlet into the flour mixture and shake off any
excess. Next, dip it into the flaxseed mixture. Finally, dip it in the
chopped pecans and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with
the remaining cutlets until everything is coated.
Place the tray in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Flip the cutlets and
bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove
from the oven and serve.

Chef Linda: Some meals elicit feelings of comfort, familiarity, and home. Eating compassionately
doesn’t mean missing out on these important aspects of food. These savory, hearty lentil meatballs
prove we can enjoy all of those feelings without causing harm to animals, our bodies, or the
environment. These meatless meatballs are firm, plump, and flavorful. Made with humble
ingredients, we’ve served them to kids, college students, and adults, and never had a meatball to
spare. Try them on a roll smothered with tomato sauce or on top of a pile of spaghetti—but most
important, share them with people you love.

Directions
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray with parchment and brush
lightly with oil.
Place lentils, water, and ½ teaspoon of the salt in a small pot on the
stove. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered,
for 20 to 25 minutes or until lentils are tender. Add water as needed to
make sure lentils are just barely covered. Remove from heat and drain
excess water, if necessary. Set aside.
In a food processor, pulse mushrooms, onion, and garlic until
chopped. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan over medium heat.
Empty contents of food processor into the pan and add remaining 1
teaspoon of salt. Cook, while stirring occasionally, for about 10
minutes, or until the onions have softened, mushrooms have browned,
and moisture has nearly evaporated.
While the mushroom mixture is cooking, place the cooked lentils,
oats, parsley, oregano, basil, and pepper in the food processor. Pulse
several times but don’t overblend as some texture is desired. Add the
cooked mushroom mixture to the food processor and pulse to
combine. Taste and adjust seasonings. Let the meatball mixture sit for
about 10 minutes, until it holds together when formed into a ball.
Use a tablespoon or portion scoop to measure out the desired sized
balls, and roll. Arrange on the baking tray. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes,
turning occasionally to ensure all sides are browned and the balls are
firm on the outside. Alternatively, the lentil meatballs can be fried in a
little oil on the stovetop. Serve over pasta, spaghetti squash, or on a
roll. Make sure to add your favorite tomato sauce.

Chef Linda: Ragù alla bolognese, or bolognese sauce, is a slow-cooked Italian meat sauce with a
creamy finish that originated in Bologna, Italy. On this side of the ocean, order pasta with bolognese
sauce and you’ll likely get tomato sauce with ground beef. In our version, ground mushrooms and
walnuts replace the meat for a hearty and healthy base. In addition to the creamy finish, the absence
of herbs like basil and oregano reiterate that bolognese sauce is not regular tomato sauce. Bolognese
is often served on tagliatelle, a wide-noodle pasta, but here we’ve served it on creamy polenta, which
makes this dish the ultimate comfort food (and gluten-free, too!). Make this for a special occasion, a
special someone, or just because you long for something soul-satisfying.
Allergens: Contains nuts, soy, and ingredients that may contain gluten
Special Equipment: Food processor
Tip: A food processor or a good sharp knife is key to the final texture of this sauce.
Ensuring that the ingredients are finely chopped is the difference between bolognese
and a vegetable sauce.
Ingredients
Bolognese
10 ounces button mushrooms
1 cup walnuts
2 Tbsps olive oil
2 Tbsps tamari or soy sauce
1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped, about 1 cup

¼ tsp crushed red pepper flakes
Ground black pepper, to taste
1 (14- to 15-ounce) can plain tomato sauce
1 cup vegetable broth, plus more to thin

3 Tbsps tomato paste
1 Tbsp nutritional yeast
1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
Polenta
6 cups water
2 Tbsps olive oil or vegan butter
2 Tbsps nutritional yeast
1 tsp salt
2 cups instant polenta
Greens
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 bunch hearty greens (like kale or chard), chopped into small pieces
3 cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp
¼ tsp salt

Directions
To make the bolognese, pulse the mushrooms and walnuts in a food
processor until finely chopped. Heat the olive oil in a large pan over
medium heat. Add the mushrooms and walnuts. Cook, stirring
occasionally, until mushrooms start to give off moisture and darken,
about 8 minutes. Add tamari and continue to cook until mushrooms
are dark brown and moisture has evaporated.
Add the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, salt, crushed red pepper flakes,
and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are
soft, about 10 minutes. Add tomato sauce, vegetable broth, milk,
tomato paste, nutritional yeast, and lemon juice. Simmer, stirring
occasionally, for about 15 minutes, until the sauce has thickened but is
still loose enough to ladle onto the polenta. Add a little more broth by

the tablespoon to thin, if necessary. Taste and add more salt and
pepper, if necessary.
To make polenta, bring water to a boil in a large pot over medium
heat. When water begins to boil, add olive oil, nutritional yeast, and
salt. Reduce heat to low. Gradually pour in the polenta, whisking
continuously until it has thickened and is soft and creamy, 1 or 2
minutes. Remove from heat and cover.
To make the greens, heat oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
Add greens, garlic, and salt. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until greens
have wilted but are still bright green. Sprinkle lemon juice over greens
and toss.
To serve, scoop polenta into a bowl, add a hearty spoonful of
bolognese sauce, and top with greens. Extra sauce can be stored in the
refrigerator for up to 1 week or frozen for up to six months. When
reheating, thin the sauce with a little water or vegetable broth.

Ingredients
Marinated Portobello
½ cup olive oil
3 Tbsps balsamic vinegar
2 Tbsps tamari or soy sauce
1 Tbsp vegan Worcestershire sauce
3 large garlic cloves, minced, about 1 Tbsp
6 large portobello mushroom caps, stems and gills removed, cut into ¼-inch thick strips
Rosemary Beans
2 Tbsps olive oil
½ medium onion, chopped, about ½ cup
3 large cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp
2 Tbsps minced fresh rosemary
1 tsp salt
2 (14-to 15.5-ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed (or 3 cups cooked)
1.
2.
3.
4.
½ cup vegetable broth, plus more to thin if necessary
1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
Ground black pepper, to taste
Chopped parsley, for garnish
Directions
To make the marinade for the portobello, put oil, vinegar, tamari,
Worcestershire, and garlic in a zip-top plastic bag and add mushroom
strips. Gently shake to combine. Place bag of mushrooms in the
refrigerator to marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large baking tray with parchment.
Remove the mushrooms, reserving ¼ cup of the marinade. Arrange
slices in a single layer on the tray and pour the reserved marinade over
the mushrooms. Roast for about 25 minutes, or until mushrooms are
smaller and very dark. They should be thick and juicy.
While mushrooms are roasting, make the rosemary beans. Heat olive
oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring
occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes or until onions are translucent and
soft. Add garlic, rosemary, and salt and cook a few minutes more,
until the rosemary and garlic are fragrant. Stir in beans, broth, and
lemon juice, and cook for another 5 minutes. Use a fork to mash the
beans in the pan into a thick, chunky mixture or purée them in a food
processor. Add more broth if you prefer a thinner consistency. Season
with ground black pepper.
Top beans with roasted mushroom slices and remaining juice from the
baking tray. Garnish with chopped parsley. Serve immediately.

MAKES 2 SMALL LOAVES (5.75-BY-3.25 INCHES) OR 12 MUFFIN-SIZED PORTIONS
Chef Linda: For many, meatloaf is a comfort food that elicits nostalgic memories of family dinners.
This meatless meatloaf recipe was developed for our “Vegan 101” cooking class to demonstrate that
from the moment we choose to go meat-free, we can still enjoy our most beloved meals—and they’ll
taste every bit as delicious as we remember. This hearty vegan version uses protein-rich lentils,
mushrooms, and nuts—along with the familiar flavors of celery, onions, carrots, and herbs that begs
to be smothered in gravy.
Allergens: Contains nuts and ingredients that may contain gluten and soy
Special equipment: Food processor
Make Ahead: Lentils can be cooked several days in advance.
Ingredients
Lentil Meatloaf
¾ cup dried green or brown lentils (or 2 cups cooked)
2 tsps salt, divided
1 medium onion, peeled and cut into small chunks, about 1 cup
2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped, about 1 cup
2 large stalks celery, chopped, about 1 cup
3 large cloves garlic, peeled
2 Tbsps oil
2 tsps dried thyme
1 tsp dried sage
Ground black pepper, to taste
10 ounces button mushrooms, quartered
1 cup walnuts
2 Tbsps vegan Worcestershire sauce (or ketchup)
1 cup regular or gluten-free breadcrumbs
1 batch Simple Golden Gravy (pg. 189)

Directions
Lightly oil two 5¾-by-3¼-inch mini loaf pans. Alternatively, you can
shape loaves with your hands and place on a parchment–lined baking
tray or use a muffin pan so each person has an individual serving.
Bake time will be slightly less when using a muffin pan.
Pick over the lentils, discarding any withered ones or stones. Place in
a medium saucepan with 1 teaspoon of salt, cover generously with
water, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 20 to 25
minutes, until tender. Drain the lentils.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Place chopped onion, carrots, celery, and garlic
into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until vegetables are finely
chopped, leaving some texture. Heat the oil in a large pan over
medium-high heat. Transfer vegetables to the pan. Add thyme, sage,
remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, and ground black pepper. Cook until the
vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes.
While the vegetables are cooking, place mushrooms, walnuts, cooked
lentils, and Worcestershire sauce into the bowl of the food processor.
Pulse until ingredients are just combined, retaining visible chunks and
texture. Do not over-process or the result will be too mushy to hold
together when sliced. Transfer mushrooms to the pan with chopped
vegetables and cook for about 5 minutes more. Add breadcrumbs and
stir to combine. Let mixture sit in the pan for about 15 minutes, until
the breadcrumbs have softened and can bind the loaves together.
Divide the mixture equally between the two prepared loaf pans and
pack down very firmly using the back of a spoon. Cover with foil.
Bake for 20 minutes then remove foil and bake for an additional 15
minutes, or until top and sides have browned and the lentil loaves
have started to pull away from the sides of the loaf pans.
When loaves are done, they will be brown along the edges and firm to
the touch. Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes; resting will
help the loaf to keep its shape when slicing. Slide a knife along the
edges and invert on a serving plate or cutting board. Flip back over so
the tops are right side up. Cut into slices and serve immediately with
simple golden gravy.

MAKES 6 TO 8 SERVINGS
Chef Sara: Long before transitioning to a vegan lifestyle, I once made a chicken tagine with the
most incredible blend of spices during a New York snowstorm that etched itself into my memory
forever. Named after a Moroccan clay cooking vessel of the same name, this recipe, with its tasty
combination of vegetables, briny olives, and bright, fresh lemon, makes a quick and easy stew that
tastes far more complex than the sum of its parts. Follow the recipe to mix your own spices or
purchase a Moroccan blend such as ras el hanout.
Ingredients
Spice Blend
1½ tsps ground cumin
1½ tsps ground coriander
1 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp ground turmeric
¼ tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp hot paprika
½ tsp sweet paprika
Generous pinch of saffron threads
Tagine
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 medium red or yellow onion, chopped, about 1 cup
4 cloves garlic, minced, about 1½ Tbsps
2 Tbsps tomato paste
3 medium carrots, cut into ½-inch chunks, about 1½ cups
1 small head cauliflower, cut into bite-size florets, about 3 cups
1 small eggplant, un-peeled, cut into ½-inch chunks, about 3 cups
4 cups vegetable broth
1½ tsps salt, plus more to taste
1 (15.5-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed (or 1½ cups cooked)
1.
2.
3.
½ cup sliced green olives
Zest and juice of 1 lemon
To Serve
¼ cup chopped mint
Directions
To make the spice mix, stir together all the spices in a small bowl and
set aside until needed.
To make the tagine, heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high
heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook until softened and
just beginning to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for
an additional minute or so, until fragrant. Stir in the spice mix and
tomato paste. Add the carrots, cauliflower, and eggplant, and stir well.
Pour in the vegetable broth and sprinkle in the salt. Bring to a boil,
reduce the heat, and cover. Allow to simmer for 20 minutes, until the
vegetables are nearly tender.
Stir in the chickpeas, olives, and lemon zest and juice, and allow to
simmer for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are
fork-tender. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired. Serve alone or
over a grain, and garnish with fresh mint. The tagine will keep in the
refrigerator for up to five days. Cooled portions freeze beautifully, and
are best enjoyed within three months.

SERVES 6 TO 8 (TWO 2-INCH SLICES PER PERSON)
Chef Linda: This recipe was developed for a Thanksgiving feast at the Sanctuary when the bounty
of the harvest season and affection for loved ones (human and nonhuman!) filled our hearts. Seasonal
butternut squash makes a luscious filling, especially when combined with plump chickpeas, crunchy
walnuts, and warming spices. Roll it all up in a flaky vegan puff pastry, and you’ve got a centerpiece
festive enough for any special meal. We like to serve this with sautéed greens for the vibrant color
contrast, as well as to balance the richness of the puff pastry. While savoring this festive dish, reflect
on how humble ingredients that come from the ground can create harmony and beauty on our tables
and in our hearts.
Allergens: Contains gluten, nuts, and ingredients that contain soy
Make Ahead: Filling can be made 1 or 2 days in advance.
Tip: Add crumbled vegan sausage to the filling for a heartier meal.
Ingredients
Roll
2 Tbsps olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped finely, about 1 cup
1 tsp salt, plus more to taste
1 medium butternut squash, about 2 pounds, peeled and cut into ½-inch pieces, about 4–5 cups
1 (15.5-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
½ cup finely chopped walnuts
3 large cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp
1 Tbsp minced fresh sage (or 1 tsp rubbed sage)
1 Tbsp fresh thyme leaves (or 1 tsp dried thyme)
1 tsp cumin
½ tsp ground cinnamon
3 Tbsps water

To Assemble
1 sheet of vegan puff pastry dough, thawed for 2 hours or overnight in the refrigerator
Olive oil, for brushing
Pinch of coarse salt
To Serve
Sautéed or steamed greens
Peanut Butter Miso Sauce (optional) (pg. 185)
Directions
To make the filling, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan over lowmedium heat. Add onion and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for
about 8 minutes, or until onion has softened and turned translucent.
Add the squash, chickpeas, walnuts, garlic, sage, thyme, cumin,
cinnamon, and water. Cover pan and cook, stirring occasionally, for
about 20 minutes, or until squash is fork-tender. When done, remove
from heat, keep covered, and set aside.
To assemble the roll, preheat the oven to 400°F. Lay out a piece of
parchment paper about the size of your baking tray. Unfold one sheet
of puff pastry on the parchment. Roll the pastry sheet into a 16-by-12-
inch rectangle. With the longest side horizontal to the counter, spoon
the butternut filling onto the bottom half of the pastry sheet to within
1 inch of the edge. Starting at the side closest to you, roll the pastry
sheet and filling up like a jelly roll. Tuck the ends under to seal. Lift
the parchment paper up and onto the baking sheet. Brush with oil and
sprinkle a little coarse salt on top. Cut 3 or 4 diagonal slits several
inches apart in the pastry to allow steam to escape.
Bake for 25 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown all over.
Remove the oven and let cool for about 5 minutes. Use a serrated
knife to slice into desired-sized portions.
Muhroo Bourguigno (Muhroo te)
SERVES 4
Chef Linda: Julia Child is known for her dedication and thoroughness in developing exquisite
recipes for the home cook. Her Boeuf Bourguignon recipe is the stuff of legends. Bourguignon refers
to the Burgundy region of France, as well as the wine used in braising the stew. While noted for her
impeccable taste in French cooking, her palate lacked sensitivity to animal suffering. By using meaty
mushrooms instead of beef and bacon, our Mushroom Bourguignon is a compassionate makeover of
the original French beef stew. We prepare pearl onions separately, according to tradition. Serve this
over noodles, rice, or potatoes to soak up the sauce, or along a side dish of buttered (vegan, of
course) spring peas or sautéed summer cherry tomatoes to add a bright note to a rich meal. Plan to
make this when you’ve got time to enjoy the process, as well as the leftover wine; I have a feeling
Julia did.
Make Ahead: Serve this dish with cooked pasta, rice, or mashed potatoes, all of
which can all be made in advance and reheated.
Ingredients
4 Tbsps olive oil, divided
2 (10-ounce) packages of button mushrooms, quartered
1½ tsps salt, divided, plus more to taste
2 large carrots, peeled and sliced ¼-inch-thick, about 1 cup
1 medium onion, finely chopped, about 1 cup
2 Tbsps all-purpose, gluten-free flour, or cornstarch
1½ cups vegetable broth
½ cup red wine, Burgundy, Chianti, or other full-bodied wine (or 1 cup vegetable broth and 1 Tbsp
apple cider vinegar)
1 Tbsp tomato paste
2 large cloves garlic, minced, about 2 tsps
2 tsps dried thyme
¼ tsp ground black pepper, plus more to taste
1 bay leaf

2.
3.
Braised Onions
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 cup frozen pearl onions, thawed
½ cup vegetable broth
1 tsp dried thyme
½ tsp salt
1 bay leaf
To Serve
Cooked mashed potatoes, rice, or noodles
Chopped parsley, to garnish
Directions
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add
mushrooms and ½ teaspoon of salt. Cook over medium-high heat,
stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, until mushrooms have
reduced in size and turned medium brown. The pan should be hot
enough so that the mushrooms “squeak” when stirred. Transfer
mushrooms to a bowl.
In the same pot, add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Add carrots and
onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes.
Add the mushrooms back into the pot and sprinkle the flour over
vegetables and stir again. Stir in broth, wine, tomato paste, garlic,
thyme, remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, black pepper, and bay leaf.
Cover, then simmer over low-medium heat for about 30 minutes.
When done, sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon
and carrots should be fork-tender. Taste and adjust salt and pepper, if
desired.
To make the braised onions, heat oil over medium- high heat in a large
pan. Add pearl onions and cook, rolling them around to brown evenly,
for about 5 minutes. Add broth, thyme, salt, and bay leaf. Cover and
simmer over low heat for 20 to 25 minutes, or until onions are tender
4.
and most of the broth has evaporated. Onions and mushrooms should
be done at about the same time.
While both the onions and the mushrooms are cooking, prepare
potatoes, rice, or noodles. Remove bay leaf and thyme sprigs from
mushrooms and onions. To serve, place potatoes, rice, or noodles in a
bowl, ladle on mushrooms and sauce, and place several onions on top.
Serve immediately, garnished with parsley.

Chef Linda: Some of the best dishes combine ordinary ingredients in a way that makes them seem
exciting and new. That’s how we feel about this dish. It confirms the truth that eliminating animals
from our diets doesn’t diminish our options—it expands them! You’ve probably had squash and
mushrooms. But when you dress them together in rich miso, spicy garlic, and sweet syrup, then roast
them to intensify the flavors, you create a complex and powerful combination of flavors that are
enhanced with a simple but delectable sauce.
Allergens: Contains peanuts, soy, and ingredients that may contain gluten
Ingredients
Squash and Mushrooms
2 Tbsps yellow miso
2 Tbsps oil
3 large cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp
2 tsps maple syrup
2 tsps tamari or soy sauce
1 small (about 1½ pounds) butternut squash, peeled and cut into ½-inch pieces, about 3 cups
1 (10-ounce) package sliced button mushrooms
Rice and Kale
1½ cups white or brown rice (or your favorite whole grain)
3 cups water
¼ tsp salt
1 bunch kale, about 1 pound, stems removed and finely chopped
Sauce

5.
4 Tbsps smooth, unsalted peanut butter
3 Tbsps tamari or soy sauce
1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil
2 tsps real maple syrup
1–2 tsps hot sauce (optional)
Up to ½ cup warm water
Garnish
2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced, about ¼ cup
½ cup salted peanuts, chopped
Directions
Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking tray with parchment.
To make the squash and mushrooms, stir together miso, oil, garlic,
syrup, and tamari in a large bowl. Add squash and mushrooms to the
bowl with the miso mixture and toss to coat evenly. The mixture will
be thick, so use a big spoon or rubber spatula, but be gentle so as not
to break the mushrooms. Empty onto the prepared baking tray and
roast for about 25 minutes. Stir midway through the cooking time.
Cook until the squash is fork-tender and lightly browned and the
mushrooms are dark brown.
While the squash and mushrooms are roasting, make the rice and kale.
Place rice, water, and salt in a large pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce
heat, cover, and simmer for about 10 minutes. Place the chopped kale
on top of rice to steam and continue cooking, covered, for about 8
minutes more, or until the liquid has evaporated. Remove from heat
and keep covered for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice and kale with a fork.
To make the sauce, whisk together peanut butter, tamari, toasted
sesame oil, syrup, and hot sauce. Slowly add water, by the tablespoon,
and whisk continuously until a thick, pourable consistency is reached.
To serve, scoop rice and kale into bowls, top with squash and
mushrooms. Garnish with scallions and peanuts and drizzle sauce
over everything. Serve immediately.

While the broth is simmering, prepare the tempeh. Preheat the oven to
425°F and line a baking tray with parchment. Place the tempeh on the
tray in a pile and drizzle with tamari and sesame oil. Toss to coat all
the pieces. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, flipping halfway through the
cooking time until the tempeh is golden brown. Remove from the
oven and allow to cool.
Remove the broth from the heat, add the green tea bags, and let sit for
5 minutes. Strain the broth, reserving the mushrooms. Thinly slice the
mushrooms and add back to the broth. Stir in the tamari and miso.
Reheat over medium to low heat until the broth is steaming but not
boiling.
To assemble the noodle bowls, place a small handful of cooked
noodles in wide soup bowl. Add a handful of spinach or kale and a
small serving of roasted tempeh. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles,
greens, and tempeh, and drizzle with toasted sesame oil. Garnish with
the sauerkraut or kimchi, scallions, and sesame seeds, and serve
immediately.

Chef Linda: Sofrito, used in so many dishes with Cuban, Puerto Rican, or Spanish influence, is that
special something you can’t quite put your finger on. It’s a unique flavor that turns a boring dish of
rice and beans into a lively affair. Flavorful and sometimes spicy, this sauce typically consists of
onions, garlic, peppers, and tomatoes, depending on what part of the world your recipe originates. In
this recipe, the sauce is used to braise spiced tofu and beans, creating a complex and delicious
combination. A dollop of cool, creamy Cashew Sour Cream (pg. 188) provides the perfect balance.
Allergens: Contains soy
Special Equipment: Food processor or blender
Tip: Make a double batch of sofrito and freeze it in ice cube trays. Pop a couple of
cubes in your rice, beans, or soup when you want a little extra south-of-the-border
zing.
Ingredients
Sofrito
2 red bell peppers, roughly chopped, about 2 cups
1 medium onion, roughly chopped, about 1 cup
¼ cup cilantro or parsley leaves, packed, plus more for garnish

1 (15.5 ounce) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed (or 1½ cups cooked)
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed (or 1½ cups cooked)
½ cup sliced black olives
To Serve
Diced avocado or prepared guacamole
Shredded lettuce
Shredded vegan cheddar cheese
Cashew Sour Cream (pg. 188), or your favorite brand
Cilantro, chopped for garnish
Directions
To make the sofrito, add the bell peppers, onion, cilantro, garlic,
jalapeño, oil, lime juice, and salt to a food processor or blender. Pulse
ingredients until finely chopped, but not completely blended.
To make the rice, place rice, water, and salt in a pot. Bring water to a
boil, then cover and reduce to a simmer. Cook for about 18 minutes or
until all the water is absorbed. Remove from heat and keep covered
for 5 minutes. Remove cover, sprinkle rice with lime juice, and fluff
with a fork. Cover to keep warm and set aside.
To make the tofu, heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Crumble
the tofu into the pan. Add cumin, oregano, chili powder, syrup, salt,
and cayenne. Toss to coat the tofu with the spices, and cook, stirring
occasionally, for about 5 minutes until spices are fragrant. Add beans,

make, but to dismiss this recipe on that account is to miss out on a tantalizing combination. When we
develop recipes for Compassionate Cuisine classes, we often look for ways to boost the nutritional
value without losing out on taste. This dish fits that bill with vitamin- and mineral-rich sweet
potatoes and a punchy spinach pesto that would make Popeye proud. This sweet, salty, and spicy dish
is easy enough for a weeknight dinner but also lovely enough to make for guests.

Directions
Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil a 9-inch by 13-inch casserole dish.
To make the shells, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the
pasta shells and oil (to prevent sticking) and cook for 10 to 12
minutes, until al dente (slightly firm to the bite). Drain and rinse under
cold water.
To make the tofu ricotta, finely crumble the tofu into a medium bowl.
Mix in remaining ingredients.
To make the filling, heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium-high
heat. Add the onion, stirring occasionally, until soft, 8 to 10 minutes.
Add the sausage, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5
minutes. Add the spinach, garlic, oregano, basil, crushed red pepper
flakes, salt, and black pepper. Cook several more minutes until heated
through. Remove from heat. Add the ricotta and ½ cup of mozzarella
to the pan. Stir to combine.
Spread a few tablespoons of sauce on the bottom of the casserole dish.
Use a spoon to generously fill the shells and arrange them, open side
up, in the casserole dish. Spoon the remaining marinara sauce over the
shells. Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella. Cover with foil and
bake for about 25 minutes, until the sauce bubbles around the edges.
Remove foil and continue baking for another 10 minutes, or until the
edges start to brown and crsip. Serve garnished with chopped basil.

Chef Linda: When the weather turns chilly and comfort food is top of mind, you’ll turn to this recipe
again and again. Traditionally, shepherd’s pie is made with ground beef or lamb. We developed this
dish for a Sanctuary cooking class on comfort food to demonstrate how using a kinder approach can
still yield familiar tastes and textures. Lentils and mushrooms provide the rich, meaty flavor. You’ll
also find the other ingredients comfortably reassuring: potatoes, carrots, onions, celery, and peas. We

1 (10-ounce) package button mushrooms, very finely chopped, about 2 cups
1 medium onion, finely chopped, about 1 cup
3 medium carrots, chopped ¼-inch pieces, about 1½ cups
3 stalks celery, chopped ¼-inch pieces, about 1½ cups
3 large cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp

4.
2 tsps dried thyme
1 tsp rubbed sage
1 tsp salt
Ground black pepper, to taste
2½ Tbsps cornstarch
2 Tbsps ketchup
2 Tbsps vegan Worcestershire sauce
2 cups vegetable broth, plus more to thin if necessary
1 cup frozen green peas, thawed
Directions
To make the mashed potato topping, cover potatoes with cold water in
a large pot and add the salt. Bring to a low boil then reduce heat to
keep potatoes at a low simmer until fork-tender. Drain potatoes and
return them to the pot. Add vegetable broth, cream cheese, butter, and
nutmeg. Using a potato masher or electric beater, slowly mix until
potatoes are relatively smooth and creamy. Don’t overmix or potatoes
will be gluey. Some chunks are welcome.
To make the lentils for the filling, add them to a pot along with salt.
Cover with at least 2 inches of water, about 2½ cups. Bring the water
to a rapid simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce to medium-low
and gently simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until lentils are tender but
not mushy. Add more liquid if necessary. Strain any remaining water.
Preheat the oven to 375°F. While the lentils and potatoes are cooking,
make the rest of the filling. Heat the oil in a large (12-inch) cast iron
skillet or oven-proof pan over medium-high heat. Add the
mushrooms, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme, sage, salt, and black
pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the moisture from
the mushrooms has cooked down and the vegetables are tender, about
15 minutes.
Sprinkle cornstarch over vegetables and stir. Add ketchup,
Worcestershire sauce, broth and stir. Add the cooked lentils and peas
to the pan and stir to combine. If the sauce is too thick, add a little
5.
water or broth to thin. There should be an ample amount of sauce with
the filling; it should not be dry. Spread the mixture evenly in the pan.
Spoon dollops of potatoes over the filling and spread, leaving swoops
and swirls, to cover. Bake until the filling bubbles around the sides
and the topping starts to turn golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve
immediately. Alternatively, you can serve from the pan without
baking.
Roate Tempe an Vegetabl Piccat
SERVES 6 TO 8
Chef Linda: Those who say “hunger is the best sauce in the world” haven’t had piccata sauce,
because surely this is the best sauce in the world! Simple and pleasantly piquant, piccata hails from
Italy and breathes life into everything it touches. Capers, garlic, and lemon juice are the classic
elements in this sauce that will make your mouth pucker. We added mushrooms to make it extra
hearty, but leave them out if you prefer. The sauce comes together without much fuss, which is hard
to imagine given the elegant result. We have no doubt you’ll use the sauce elsewhere—think mashed
potatoes, rice, pasta, seitan . . . you get the idea!
Allergens: Contains soy and ingredients that may contain soy
Ingredients
1 (8-ounce) package tempeh, cut into ½-inch cubes
1½ cups water, enough to cover the tempeh
3 Tbsps tamari or soy sauce
1 pound of waxy potatoes (Yukon, yellow, or red), unpeeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
½ pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved lengthwise
3 Tbsps olive oil
1 tsp salt
Piccata Sauce
2 Tbsps olive oil
½ medium onion, thinly sliced, about ½ cup
½ tsp salt
1 cup thinly sliced button mushrooms
3 cloves garlic, sliced very thinly or minced, about 1 Tbsp
2 Tbsps vegan butter
2 Tbsps cornstarch or arrowroot
2 cups vegetable broth
3 Tbsps fresh lemon juice

4.
5.
2 Tbsps capers, drained and rinsed
Ground black pepper, to taste
Chopped parsley, to garnish
Directions
Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large baking tray with parchment.
In a small pot, cover the tempeh with the water and tamari. Bring to a
boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 10 minutes. Drain
tempeh.
Arrange the seasoned tempeh, potatoes, and Brussels sprouts on the
baking tray in a single layer. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with
salt. Use your hands to toss together and coat everything with oil.
Roast in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until potatoes and Brussels
sprouts can be pierced easily with a sharp knife.
While tempeh and vegetables are roasting, make the piccata sauce.
Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion and salt. Cook,
stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, until onion is soft and
translucent. Add the mushrooms, garlic, and butter. Continue to cook
for about 8 minutes, until mushrooms have browned and cooked all
the way through.
Make a slurry by stirring together in a small bowl the cornstarch and a
couple of tablespoons of the broth until smooth; this prevents lumps
in the sauce. Pour this into the pan and quickly add the remaining
broth while stirring. Cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens.
Stir in lemon juice, capers, and black pepper. Transfer tempeh and
vegetables from baking tray to pan. Stir to coat with sauce and remove
from heat. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley.

SERVES 6 TO 8
Chef Linda: We’re in love with the combination of textures and flavors that create this earthy,
wholesome dish. Celery root, or celeriac, is knobby and gnarly on the outside, but once peeled, you’ll
find its grassy, delicate celery flavor delightful in recipes like this one. Try it in cool-weather soups
and stews as an alternative to potatoes. If you can’t find celery root, parsnips make a fine substitute,
as do carrots—just watch the cooking time and adjust to ensure proper doneness. Fennel adds a
delicate sweet note here—whether sautéed, roasted, or raw, get to know this versatile vegetable, and
you’ll add interest to everyday dishes.
Allergens: Contains nuts
Tip: This dish is equally delicious as a salad. Chill and make the dressing in a
separate bowl, then toss right before serving.
Ingredients
Dressing
⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil
⅓ cup fresh lemon juice, from about 3–4 lemons
1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 Tbsp maple syrup
1 Tbsp yellow mustard
½ tsp salt, plus more to taste
Ground black pepper, to taste
Lentils
¾ cup dry green or brown lentils, or 2 cups cooked
½ teaspoon salt
Vegetables
2 Tbsps olive oil

4.
1 pound celery root/celeriac, peeled with a sharp knife, cut in ½-inch pieces, about 2 cups
1 bulb fennel, fronds and stems trimmed, bulb halved and quartered very thinly sliced, about 2 cups
½ tsp salt
½ bunch of curly kale, chopped into bite-sized pieces, about 3 cups, packed
½ cup chopped walnuts
½ cup dried cranberries or dried cherries
Directions
To make the dressing, mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl.
Taste and add more salt, if desired.
Pick over the lentils, discarding any withered ones or stones. Place
them in a medium pot, cover generously with water, add salt, and
bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, until
just tender. Drain the lentils and empty into the bowl with the
dressing. Avoid overcooking as lentils should be tender with a bit of a
bite, not mushy.
To make the vegetables, heat the oil over medium- high heat in a large
pan. Add celeriac and cook, stirring only occasionally allowing the
sides to brown nicely, 10 to 12 minutes. Add fennel and salt. Continue
to cook, stirring occasionally, for about 7 more minutes, until the
fennel starts to soften and turn translucent. Add the kale and stir
together. Cook for another 3 to 5 minutes until the kale is soft and
bright green and the celeriac is fork-tender.
Add the vegetables to the bowl with the lentils and dressing. Add
walnuts and dried cranberries and toss to combine. Serve immediately.
Swedi Meatball an Grav
MAKES 20 TO 24 MEATBALLS
Chef Linda: There are so many ways to make a delicious vegan meatball—with lentils, mushrooms,
nuts, seitan, or tempeh. This compassionate version uses eggplant and white beans. The distinction
between Italian-style and Swedish-style meatballs is mainly in the sauce. Italian meatballs are served
in a tangy tomato sauce whereas Swedish meatballs are finished in a rich gravy made with sour
cream or plain yogurt. The Swedish version is perfect to cozy up to on a cold winter’s night. As the
Swedes say, there’s no bad weather, just bad clothes, so, as a nod to their origin, our Swedish
meatballs have a heavy coat of breadcrumbs. We like the way it helps them stand up to the luscious
gravy—and maybe it keeps them warm, too. Serve with classic pairings like mashed potatoes or
noodles, or try a lighter approach and use spiralized zucchini (raw or quickly sautéed in a pan).
Allergens: Contains nuts, soy and ingredients that may contain gluten
Special Equipment: Food processor
Tip: If there are fewer mouths to feed, set aside extra meatballs before adding them to
the pan with the gravy, and freeze them for up to 3 months. Extra gravy can also be
frozen for up to 3 months.
Ingredients
Swedish Meatballs
4 Tbsps olive oil, divided
1 medium eggplant, about 1 pound, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 small onion, finely chopped, about ½ cup
1 tsp salt
3 large garlic cloves, minced, about 1 Tbsp
1 cup old-fashioned oats
2 cups plain or panko breadcrumbs, divided
½ cup walnuts
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp ground allspice
1.
2.
¼ tsp ground nutmeg
¼ tsp ground black pepper
1 (15.5-ounce) can white beans, drained and rinsed
Gravy
¼ cup vegan butter
¼ cup all-purpose flour
3 cups vegetable broth
⅓ cup nutritional yeast
2 Tbsps tamari or soy sauce
1 Tbsp vegan Worcestershire sauce
2 tsps Dijon or yellow mustard
½ tsp white pepper (or ground black pepper)
¼ tsp salt
1 cup unsweetened, plain nondairy yogurt
To Serve
Chopped parsley
Sautéed spiralized vegetables, like zucchini
Cooked noodles or mashed potatoes
Directions
To make the meatballs, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over
medium heat. Add the eggplant, onion, and salt. Cook, stirring
occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes, until the eggplant is translucent
and very soft. Add garlic in the last couple of minutes of cooking.
Remove from heat and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray with parchment.
Depending on the size of your food processor, you may need to do the
next step in two batches. In a food processor, pulse together the oats, 1
cup of breadcrumbs, walnuts, salt, allspice, nutmeg, and black pepper.
Add the white beans and process until combined. Transfer the
eggplant to the food processor, scraping in any brown bits in the pan,
and pulse until everything is combined. The mixture should be fairly
well-blended but retain some texture. Set the pan aside for making the
gravy.

4.
5.
Spread remaining 2 tablespoons of oil on the parchment. Place the
remaining 1 cup of breadcrumbs in a small bowl. Using a tablespoon
or portion scoop, shape the mixture into balls approximately 1½
inches in diameter. Place remaining breadcrumbs in a wide, shallow
bowl. Roll each meatball in the breadcrumbs and arrange on the
baking tray. Bake for about 30 minutes, until the meatballs are firm
and crispy on the outside.
While the meatballs are baking, make the gravy. Melt the butter in the
eggplant pan. Whisk in the flour and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk
in the broth and stir until smooth and thickened. Stir in nutritional
yeast, tamari, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, pepper, and salt. Gently
simmer over medium-low heat until the gravy thickens, about 5
minutes. Stir in yogurt. Taste and add more salt if you like.
Transfer meatballs to the pan and spoon gravy over them. Cook gently
for about 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle with parsley,
and serve with spiralized vegetables or your favorite noodles or
mashed potatoes.

Chef Linda: Sausage and peppers, with its classic aroma of sweet caramelized onions, oregano,
basil, and fennel, is a classic comfort food. To prove we don’t need animals to create our favorite
dishes, we developed this recipe for a Compassionate Cuisine “Vegan 101” class using tempeh, a
heart-healthy, high-protein food. A light, crisp salad will complete your meal. You just might want to
double the recipe because the intoxicating aroma from your kitchen may attract friends you never
knew you had.

In a small pot, cover the tempeh with water and tamari. Bring to a
boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 10 minutes. Drain
tempeh, reserving about ¼ cup of cooking liquid.
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
Working in batches, arrange slices of tempeh in a single layer in pan,
adding another 1 tablespoon of oil, if necessary, as you go. Cook for 3
to 4 minutes on each side, until the tempeh starts to brown. Transfer
tempeh to a paper towel–lined plate.
Use the same pan to make the vegetables. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil
over medium-high heat. Add peppers and salt. Cook, stirring
occasionally, for about 8 minutes, until peppers start to soften. Add
onions, garlic, oregano, basil, fennel, crushed red pepper, and black
pepper. Continue to cook for about 10 minutes, until the peppers and
onions are very soft and have begun to turn brown around the edges.
Return the tempeh to the pan and gently stir to combine. Add reserved
cooking liquid and cook several minutes more until flavors have
mingled and some of the liquid has cooked down. Serve immediately
over cooked rice or on rolls.

Chef Sara: This recipe has a sentimental backstory: it’s one that I wrote for my cooking audition at
the Sanctuary! Several years and many cooking classes later, it’s still beloved for its great taste and
ease of preparation. This fresh, simple take on Thai red curry features protein- and fiber-rich
chickpeas, as well as two beloved nutritional powerhouses, sweet potatoes and kale. Serve this curry
over your favorite cooked grain for an easy, satisfying meal any day of the week.
Allergens: Contains soy and ingredients that may contain gluten
Tip: Add more sriracha sauce if you like your curry with a kick, or omit it entirely for a
milder flavor.
Ingredients
2 tsps coconut oil
1 medium red onion, chopped, about 1 cup
3–4 Tbsps Thai red curry paste
1 (13.5-ounce) can regular (not light) coconut milk
2 Tbsps tamari or soy sauce
2–3 tsps sriracha or hot sauce, to suit your level of desired spiciness (optional)
1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into ½-inch cubes, approximately 2 cups
1 large bunch lacinato kale, stems removed, leaves cut into bite-sized pieces, about 4–5 cups
1 (15.5-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed, about 1½ cups
⅓ cup fresh Thai basil leaves, lightly packed, chopped (or Italian basil)
1 Tbsp fresh lime juice
Rice or grain of your choice
Fresh lime wedges
Directions
1.
2.
3.
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium- high heat. Add the
chopped onion and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until
softened and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the curry paste and
mix thoroughly, coating the onions with the paste to help prevent
clumps of curry in the sauce. Cook for another 30 seconds or so, until
fragrant.
Add the coconut milk, tamari, and sriracha sauce and mix well. Add
the diced sweet potato. If the sweet potato isn’t covered by the
coconut milk mixture, add ¼ to ½ cup water so there is enough liquid
to simmer evenly. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and cover.
Simmer for 10 minutes, or until nearly tender. Add the kale and
chickpeas, then cover again. Simmer gently for 8 to 10 minutes, until
the kale is wilted and the sweet potato is fully cooked.
Stir in the chopped basil and lime juice. Serve with your choice of rice
or grain and fresh lime wedges. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator
for three to five days.

MAKES 6 SERVINGS
Chef Sara: Prepared during a popular Valentine’s Day Compassionate Cuisine cooking class at the
Sanctuary, our luscious risotto proves that even classic comfort foods can be made simply and
deliciously vegan. For an umami boost, the mushrooms are roasted in the oven instead of sautéed.
We used a local, artisan herbed cheese spread for extra creaminess, but any vegan cream cheese or
your favorite soft cheese spread.
Allergens: Contains ingredient that contain nuts
Ingredients
Roasted Mushrooms
1 pound brown button mushrooms, thickly sliced, about 2–3 cups
4 ounces oyster mushrooms, pulled apart into individual “petals”
1 Tbsp olive oil
Salt, to taste
Ground black pepper, to taste
Risotto
6 cups vegetable broth
1 tsp salt, plus more to taste
Ground black pepper, to taste
2 Tbsps olive oil
2 large shallots, finely chopped, about ½ cup
3 cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp
1 Tbsp chopped fresh thyme, leaves only (or 1½ tsps dried thyme)
1½ cups uncooked Arborio rice
½ cup dry white wine (or 1 cup vegetable broth and 1 Tbsp mild vinegar)
¼ cup vegan cream cheese or herbed cheese spread (optional, but highly recommended)
Chopped parsley, for garnish

6.
Directions
Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a baking tray with parchment.
In a large bowl, toss the mushrooms with the oil, sprinkle with salt
and pepper, then spread in a single layer on the prepared tray. Transfer
to the oven and bake for approximately 20 minutes, until the
mushrooms have shrunken and are starting to brown. Remove from
the oven and allow to cool.
To make the risotto, while the mushrooms are roasting, heat the
vegetable broth in a medium pot. Add the salt and black pepper. Taste
the broth; it should taste a bit salty. Don’t worry, this extra saltiness is
necessary to properly flavor the rice. If the broth you used was lowsodium, add a pinch more salt. Keep the broth hot over low heat as
you continue with the recipe.
Heat the oil in a wide, heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Add
the shallots plus a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until
translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, and rice, and
cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, until the rice starts to become
translucent. Add the wine and allow to cook, stirring frequently, until
the wine is mostly absorbed into the rice.
Add one or two ladles of hot broth to the rice and cook, stirring
frequently, until the broth is almost absorbed by the rice. Adjust the
heat as necessary so the risotto bubbles gently, but doesn’t boil
vigorously. Add another one or two ladles of broth, and repeat this
process until you’ve used all but one ladle of the broth. This will take
25 to 30 minutes. When finished, the rice will be tender all the way
through but still al dente (slightly firm) in the center, surrounded by a
creamy sauce. To make the stirring feel less tedious, recruit a loved
one to help you out, or put on your favorite music or podcast.
Stir in the roasted mushrooms, remaining broth, and cheese. Cook
briefly until heated through and bubbling. Serve immediately,
garnished with parsley.
Eas Veg i Bake Zit
SERVES 6 TO 8
Chef Linda: Comforting baked ziti has a place in everyone’s heart. Made for family meals, this
familiar favorite was remade, without dairy, for kids in our summer camp. Tofu makes a rich, ricottalike cheese that’s high in protein and only imperceptibly different from dairy-based ricotta. We add
cauliflower to the pasta as it cooks to add texture and boost nutrition; it secretly melts into the
softness of the dish and goes undetected. Substitute broccoli if you prefer, or use them both. It’s a
dish you’ll look forward to every time.
Allergens: Contains soy
Make Ahead: Tofu ricotta can be made 1 or 2 days in advance.
Tip: If you have hearty appetites to handle, sauté some sliced vegan sausage and
add when assembling the dish. This dish freezes well, so make a double batch and
freeze before baking, then thaw in the refrigerator overnight and bake at 350°F for
about 1 hour.
Ingredients
1 pound dried regular or gluten-free ziti or penne
2 cups fresh or frozen cauliflower florets
Tofu Ricotta
1 (14- to 16-ounce) package of firm tofu
¼ cup of unsweetened nondairy milk
¼ cup nutritional yeast
2 Tbsps fresh lemon juice
2 tsps olive oil
2 tsps onion powder
1 tsp garlic powder
½ tsp salt
Sauce
1.
2.
3.
1 (32-ounce) jar marinara sauce, or 4 cups of homemade sauce, or more if you desire, divided
2 tsps dried oregano
2 tsps dried basil
½ tsp crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
1½ cups shredded vegan mozzarella cheese, divided
Chopped fresh basil or parsley, to garnish
Directions
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Add the ziti to the pot and cook according to package directions. With
about 5 minutes left to cook, add the cauliflower, and bring to a gentle
boil again. Continue cooking until pasta is al dente (soft with a little
bite to it) and cauliflower is fork-tender. Note that the addition of
vegetables will increase the stated cooking time of the pasta so check
the pasta and cook accordingly. The key to success is to not overcook
the pasta when boiling because it will cook again in the oven. Drain
the pasta and cauliflower and return them to the pot.
While the pasta is cooking, make the tofu ricotta. Finely crumble the
tofu into a medium bowl. Add milk, nutritional yeast, lemon juice,
olive oil, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt. Mix until all
ingredients are thoroughly combined.
To make the sauce, add about ⅔ of the marinara, oregano, basil, and
crushed red pepper flakes to the pasta and stir to combine. Add the
tofu ricotta and 1 cup of mozzarella. Stir gently. Empty the pasta into
a large casserole dish and top with remaining sauce. Sprinkle with
remaining mozzarella. Bake for about 20 minutes until heated through
and the cheese is melted. Remove from oven, garnish with parsley,
and serve immediately.

Return the tray to the oven for about 10 minutes, or until the cheese
has melted. Let mushrooms stand for a few minutes. Garnish with
chopped basil before serving.
Sanctuar to
FULL THROTTLE
I’d be lying if I said that our animal care crew cruises through winter
unscathed, happily ignoring every insult that the season hurls their way.
They don’t. The challenges of a tough winter—below zero temperatures,
snowstorms that dump two feet or more at a time, gale-force winds—test
their grit and their heart, because no matter the weather, the work of caring
well for three hundred charges must still get done. Animals must be
blanketed, bedding in pig houses doubled or even tripled to ensure our
porcine friends’ safety and warmth, chicken wattles must be coated with
Vaseline to prevent frostbite. On days like this, the animal care team is in
full throttle, ensuring that even though they are struggling to stay warm, our
animals are comfortable.
What does full-throttle actually look like? Well, rather than blanketing
the three or four most compromised horses or goats, for instance, caretakers
blanket dozens of elderly animals. On the most treacherous days, our
elderly and blind horses stay inside, so cleaning our twenty-stall main barn
is far more difficult—there is exponentially more manure. Caretakers pile
straw four feet high in the pig barn, and program overhead heaters to turn
on during the bitterest hours of the long, cruel nights. Where it’s safe to
hang heat lamps, they do so, and where it isn’t, chickens move into our
heated offices, which adds many additional crates to the daily cleaning
schedule.
And there’s more to “full throttle” than the extra care the animals
require. Locks and latches freeze shut and must be warmed or pried with
gloveless hands, and sometimes fingers freeze to the metal itself. On days
when two feet of snow has blanketed the ground overnight, Rich and Josh,
our intrepid maintenance duo, alternate between snow blowing and snow
plowing all day long so we have access to the thirty-five pastures and
paddocks where our animals live, and Animal Care Director Kelly Mullins
walks “equine alley” to determine whether it’s too icy to risk turning out the
horses. Our animal care team battles stress, worry, and exhaustion, on top of
the sometimes subzero gale-force winds. Still, running on empty, they smile
and grit their way through. Yes. Whatever it takes to ensure that our
animals are okay. That’s what “full throttle” looks like.
So it was this team, already worn weary by the season itself, that found
Pliers, a thirty-five-year-old horse rescued from hopelessness with his
mother fifteen months earlier, down in his paddock one early February
morning, pinned awkwardly against the fence. This dangerous position is
referred to as being “cast,” and describes when a horse has either laid down
or rolled so close to a wall or fence that he can’t get his footing to stand.
Judging by his appearance (described by Health Care Manager Kellie
Myers as “beyond the shivering stage”), Pliers had been down for hours. He
was as still as a stone.
Dr. Andrea Sotela of Rhinebeck Equine was called, and so was Kelly
Mullins, Animal Care Director, who rushed in on her day off.
My phone rang at 8:15 a.m.
“Stevens,” said Mullins. “Are you here?”
I wasn’t. I was ninety minutes away.
“Pliers is down,” she said. “We don’t yet know what we’re dealing with,
but we’ve got an all-hands-on-deck situation.”
“I’ll take care of it,” I said, easing my car off the thruway in order to
make phone calls. “And I’ll be there as soon as I can.”
By the time I arrived, the barn was humming as staff and volunteers
who’d dropped everything to come in on their day off cleaned stalls, filled
hayracks and water buckets, and washed dishes. While the caretakers tried
to save one precious life, the backup team managed the care of three
hundred others.
I hurried down “equine alley” and from a distance saw seven people—
two vets and five staff— clustered around a prone horse; even Rich, our
buildings and grounds guy, was there in case we needed the tractor to lift
Pliers or, more likely, to bury him.
I climbed over the gate. Another caretaker, Matt, was holding Ashley,
Pliers’ blind mother, in the run-in, away from her son. Still neurotically
attached to him despite remarkable progress, she’d been sedated twice.
Pliers was in the middle of the paddock, covered with a thermal blanket and
additional ones. Caretaker Kate, encrusted in mud, held a bag of IV fluids,
the umpteenth Pliers had received that morning.
Dr. Sotela ran down the scenario for me: the team had rolled Pliers over
and away from the fence. They got him up. He fell. They got him up again.
He fell again. He was too depleted, and the paddock, muddy from the rapid
snow melt, was working against him. Dr. Sotela rattled off his body
temperature (5 degrees below normal), a description of his gut sounds, the
medications he’d received, the liters of fluids. And then the plan of action:
more fluids, keep him settled as his body temperature rose and he recovered
strength, and then three more attempts to help him stand. The first would be
manual—just human strength and the will and reserves of a very old, very
tired horse. If that failed, they’d attempt to lift him with heavy straps
shoved under his belly. The final effort would utilize the tractor and tow
straps to lift him into the air then gently lower him down, supporting him as
he tried to bear his own weight.
“Mullins, are you on board with this?” I asked.
“Sure am,” she said with conviction. “That’s what we’re gonna do.”
Sanctuary work demands that we be damned good at assessing when it’s
time to let an animal go. To prolong the fight, and consequently the
suffering, of an old, worn out animal is no more ethically justifiable than
doing the same thing to one’s own grandparent. One needs the wisdom to
know not only how possible a good outcome is, but also what the animal
would want, if he could speak. And then one needs the courage to honor
that choice. We give these gut-wrenching moments our very best, but once
we’ve done so, and we see that the fight in a precious life is gone, then our
final act of love is to let go.
I looked at Pliers’s face. I watched his labored breathing. I thought
about his age, and about the years of neglect and the extent to which they’d
taken their toll. And I felt certain that these were Pliers’s final moments.
But I hadn’t been there for the previous three hours to see what had led up
to right now. More important, I trusted the wisdom and the guts of our team
to know when to say, “Enough.” So while it was all I could do not to say,
“I’m so sorry you disagree, but we’re done here, guys,” I didn’t. Pliers, and
the team, would continue to have their shot at the unlikeliest of happy
endings.
I returned to the main barn, our hub. In the feed room, I organized the
cleaning list: the sheep needed to be stripped; the piglets, ditto; Mario and
Audrey’s barn; the goats. The list grew. I transferred it to the cleaning board
in the aisle, assigned staff to various tasks, then picked up my own tools—
pitchfork, shovel, rake—and loaded them into the “Daisy Duke,” our
fluorescent yellow and orange work truck. I headed to one of the smaller
pig barns, climbed the gate, and began cleaning. Shovel, lift, toss. Shovel,
lift, toss. The barn emptied and the Daisy Duke filled, as Mario the pig kept
me company.
“Are you having a good day?” I asked him. “Umph,” he replied.
“Umph. Umph.” As I continued cleaning, he continued chatting.
I’d only been working for forty-five minutes but needed water, so I
walked into the barn to discover Kelsey, our newest caretaker, putting way
too many shavings in a stall.
“Hey, love, you can be a little less generous,” I suggested.
“Mullins told me to put down extra shavings for the horses.”
“What horses?” I asked.
“Ashley and Pliers.”
My heart in my throat, I high-tailed it down equine alley to see ancient,
blind Ashley being led from the pasture toward the main barn. And behind
her, caked in mud from the tip of his ears to the bottom of his tail, came
Pliers, steadied by Kate, the filthiest, happiest human I’d ever seen, taking
one slow, tentative step toward the main barn. He was shaky, but very much
alive.
Pliers hadn’t had the energy to stand with human help, so in the end,
tow straps and the long arms of the tractor bucket lifted him straight into the
air and stood him on his feet. Limp when Rich had hoisted him, Pliers had
the good sense to lean against the tractor for support when his feet touched
the ground. There, still supported by the tow straps, he eagerly accepted hot
mash and hay. Minutes passed as the crew stood surrounding him, surely as
exhausted as our old boy. Eventually his shaking legs steadied. Once that
happened, they removed the support straps, and then his walk to the barn
began: a few steps. Rest. A few more. Rest again. His ordeal, it seemed,
was over.
“It’s a miracle,” was the whispered refrain, because frankly, not one of
us expected this ending. But a “miracle” is not what unfolded that February
morning in a muddy paddock at Catskill Animal Sanctuary. Instead, the
know-how of a good vet; the guts, grace, and grit of a bone-weary animal
care team; and the trust of a horse not quite ready to pack it in coalesced to
allow that old boy to live to see another day. Come to think of it, maybe that
is a miracle.
That same night, I walked down to the barn and found Pliers snoozing
in a warm barn stall, his body and psyche recovering from as much of a
near-death situation as I’ve witnessed in my seventeen years of doing this
work. Mama Ashley was in the stall next to him. A huge open window in
the dividing wall allowed them to touch whenever they needed to. Down
the aisle, Sister Mary Frances, our free-ranging potbelly pig, snored under a
four-foot mound of straw and blankets. Hermione the goat called for me,
and I headed down the aisle to say hello. All was well.
The crew that agreed to accept Ashley and Pliers to prevent them from
being shot by their owner will face more winter days like this. But they will
show up, on time and smiling, to give their very best, no matter what it
takes. Because that’s what they do. Just ask Pliers.
The crew that cares for the animals and the Sanctuary that protects them is the
“special sauce” that makes us who we are. Without their undivided loyalty to our
animal ambassadors, our work to educate and inspire would fall flat. Like our Caesar
dressing (pg. 188), Artichoke-Cannellini Alfredo Sauce (pg. 187), and our Peanut
Butter Miso Sauce (pg. 185), they work hard to add life, flavor, and vitality to this lifesaving work.
Sauce an Dressing
And all at once, the meal comes to life with a drizzle or a splash—
it’s all in the sauce. There are whole books to be written on sauce,
but here we offer just few of ours that have accompanied the dishes
in this book. Sauces and dressings are like peacemakers or
instigators; they gently unite disparate ingredients or incite a riot of
flavors. Use these where you see fit. Contemplate their
compassionate ingredients. Then create your own sauces, and don’t
keep them a secret.

Sanctuar to
I AM CHICKEN. LOOK THE HELL OUT.
Sanctuaries have known for a long time that far from being “bird-brained,”
chickens are bright, multifaceted individuals. After all, we engage with
them 365 days a year, so we know them as well as you know the dog who
pushes you to the corner of the bed at night or the cat who stretches across
your keyboard. At Catskill, our free-range “Underfoot” chickens elicit
wonder, laughter, respect, and delight from those of us lucky enough to
move among them each day. Truly, truly: to know chickens is to love them.
Meet Sidra, for example. Sidra is a White Leghorn, the breed typically
grown for its egg-laying capacity. A cheeky, active breed, Leghorns are
crammed into wire cages and endure lives one wouldn’t wish upon the
vilest human. Sidra is one of the lucky ones. She is smart, as are most
chickens, but that’s just the start. Sidra is larger than life (all four pounds of
her), living with abandon and keeping us on our toes every step of the way.
Curious and exceptionally confident, Sidra loves to explore both the
“Welcome Hut” and “Peabody’s Place,” a temporary space that houses our
cooking demos and educational programs. The hut is the place where guests
check in, but it also doubles as our retail space. As visitors shop for T-shirts,
books, cards, or other Catskill memorabilia, Sidra appears to shop, too,
weaving between guests, inspecting items large and small while clearly
hoping some are edible. With a grand sense of entitlement, she hops onto
chairs in Peabody’s Place, pecking at grains in the whole foods exhibit or
watching intently as Chef Sara demonstrates how to make chicken salad
sans the animal. Sidra approves.
But it’s at mealtime when Sidra’s true daring emerges. She and her
family—rooster Sebastian and hen Pilar—make a mad dash to the pig barn
when the feed truck leaves, because they know that it is the first stop, but
also because pigs eat . . . well, they eat like pigs, chomping robustly, food
flying in every direction from their mouths (what they lack in finesse they
make up for in gusto). Unlike Sebastian and Pilar, who hang back until the
pigs are finished, Sidra defies death each time she makes a mad dash into
the barn and zips around between eight hungry pigs, any of whom could
crush her with a quick jerk of the head, or worse, with a “GET THE HELL
AWAY FROM MY BREAKFAST!” chomp on her tiny body. No mind. She
is chicken. Look the hell out.
And look the hell out especially when it comes to Sidra’s task of laying
eggs. With literally thousands of places to choose from (she’s a free-range
bird on a 150-acre farm, for Lord’s sake) Sidra insists on a single spot: in
the barn kitchen, inside a half-bag of soft pine shavings placed under the
kitchen table. Why she’s so obsessively particular is curious to us, but we
like to think she believes that one day, a tiny chick will emerge from one of
those eggs, and what better place for a baby to be born than in a warm, soft,
fluffy bed of shavings tucked under a table for protection, and in a heated
kitchen, no less? We like to think, in other words, that Sidra’s behavior is
maternal instinct on steroids.
I was sitting in the long barn aisle, near the kitchen, my back against
Callie the horse’s stall wall, when I first observed the insanity. It was just
me, Russell the potbelly pig, and chickens Sebastian, Pilar, and Sidra.
Russell, Sebastian, Pilar and I were chillin’. Sidra, not so much. Sidra paced
back and forth, back and forth in front of the kitchen door. She was willing
it to open, and she was swearing her tiny head off.
Animal caretaker Crystal entered the barn.
“Why is she having a meltdown?” I asked, as Sidra continued pacing
like a maniac.
“We’ve blocked the cat door from the other side so she can’t come in,”
Crystal explained.
Catskill Animal Sanctuary’s “kitchen” is located in the center of our
main barn. It’s a large, high-ceilinged room where we not only prepare
individualized meals twice a day, but also store everything from grain to
towels to some of our medical supplies. But the inappropriately named
“kitchen” is also where some of our most vulnerable birds are housed at
night in safe, cozy crates bedded generously with shavings. These birds—
some with injuries, some with permanent disabilities—are allowed, if
appropriate, to free range during the day. But housing them in “the kitchen”
is the best way to keep a close eye on them.
Sidra is not one of the vulnerable, but with human traffic in and out of
the kitchen all day long, she easily made it her daytime home and soon
discovered the delight of laying her egg inside that bag of soft shavings
intended for the crates of the other birds. She figured out in no time that if
the human door was closed, then the cat door doubled as a fine chicken
door, and she used it whenever she wanted to lay an egg or steal a grape
from the produce containers.
If Sidra’s behavior had been limited to laying eggs and pilfering
produce, all would be well. But NO. Free access to the kitchen proved
problematic, for when other chickens dared to share the roomy space, she
pecked them, chased them, and harassed them relentlessly. A generous
spirit, she is not. Underscored. So Sidra has been booted out into the barn
aisle during work hours.
To make matters worse, we humans foiled her Plan B.
Sidra learned in a nanosecond that if the front entrance to the maternity
ward (Promised Land? What else?) was blocked, she could go to the back—
by traveling down the long barn aisle, circling behind the barn, walking
down a little path, hopping over the washroom door, and stealthily hiding
until someone opened the back door to the kitchen.
But because she’s a bully, we now make sure that the top half of the
washroom door is locked. Permanently. No back door entry. No front
door/cat door entry. She simply can’t get in. Hence the meltdown.
You’d think that with all the other options available, Little Miss Thing
would choose another protected area, another bed of soft shavings. Nope.
Her determination to lay her egg in the shavings . . . in the kitchen . . . under
the table is all-consuming. The other day, for instance, a new volunteer
named Samantha thought she was walking past a small hen perched
peacefully on a shelf just outside the kitchen door when suddenly she was
dive bombed by a crazed white bird.
“I thought, ‘Oh, how sweet . . . that chicken feels safe enough to rest
right there with humans coming in and out all day,’” Samantha explained.
“But the second I opened the kitchen door, she LOST HER MIND. She
came right at my head. All I could see were wings flapping and legs
flailing, and then she was over my shoulder, running through the kitchen
and jumping into that shavings bag.”
Samantha paused to recover, and had the composure to smile. “What
was that about?” she asked.
I picture Sidra making her nest in the bed of shavings.
Mission accomplished.
It would seem Sidra’s sassy side could use a little sweetening up. And do we have just
the thing! An Apple Fritter Cake (pg. 196) drizzled with sugar glaze. A Coconut Cream
Pie sweet and silky enough to make you weep (pg. 203). And it’s only fair to warn you
about the cheesecake. Oh, the cheesecake (pg. 215). Sidra, we’d be crabby, too, if we
couldn’t eat these irresistible delights. Make them all, friends.
Sweet an Treat
What a tragedy life would be without the promise of something
sweet. Whether it politely punctuates the end of a meal, barges into
the middle of our day, or whispers to us late at night, there comes a
time when we must succumb to a sweet treat. These recipes span
the spectrum of humble to grand and affirm the extraordinary truth
that we can indulge without animals. Cakes, cookies, tarts, or pies
—they’re all here, and they’re all clamoring to be made.

SERVES 8 TO 12
Chef Linda: Usually reserved for savory dishes, sweet potatoes have a wild side that thrives when
paired with the sweeter things in life. In this recipe, we’ve given the familiar apple crisp a new twist
by using these earthy, orange, beauties. To enhance their gentle, sweet flavor, we added fresh
cranberries to lend a tart, bright accent and a bevy of health benefits. Impossibly scrumptious,
healthy, and compassionate, this crisp is a hard act to follow. And it’s delicious with a scoop of vegan
ice cream or our Coconut Whipped Cream (pg. 223). Oh, how many ways can you say “yum”?
Allergens: Contains gluten and nuts
Tip: Use dried cranberries when fresh are out of season; just simmer the same
quantity in ¾ cup orange juice to plump them up.
Ingredients
Filling
3 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and diced in ½-inch pieces, about 1 pound or 4 cups
1 cup fresh cranberries
¾ cup orange juice
¼ cup brown sugar, packed
2 tsps ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground nutmeg
1 tsp vanilla extract
Topping
½ cup old-fashioned oats
½ cup whole wheat flour
½ cup chopped pecans
¾ cup granulated sugar
1 tsp ground cinnamon
¼ tsp salt
1.
2.
3.
¼ cup maple syrup
¼ cup coconut oil, melted
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large bowl, mix together the sweet
potatoes, cranberries, orange juice, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg,
and vanilla. Empty into a 9-inch square casserole dish.
To make the topping, use the same bowl to mix the oats, flour, pecans,
sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Add syrup and coconut oil and stir. Spoon
the topping evenly over the sweet potato- cranberry filling and gently
press down.
Bake covered with foil for 50 to 60 minutes until the sides are
bubbling and the sweet potatoes are soft. Serve warm or at room
temperature.
Appl Frit e Cak
MAKES ONE (9-INCH) PAN, 9 TO 12 PIECES
Chef Linda: Inspired by the old-fashioned taste of apple fritters, this cake is moist, studded with bits
of apples, and drizzled with a sweet sugar glaze. We love serving it in the fall, when local apples are
at their peak and the scent of the spices tempt our Homestead guests to rise and shine. Any firm,
slightly tart apples will work, but don’t let the search for the right ones keep you from making this
cake. Just one bite proves that butter and eggs are not necessary to bake a decadent dessert.
Allergens: Contains gluten
Ingredients
Filling
1¼ pounds apples, about 4, chopped in ½-inch pieces, about 4 cups, like Honeycrisp or Gala
2 Tbsps brown sugar
1 tsp ground cinnamon
2 Tbsps water
Cake
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
½ cup apple or orange juice
½ cup granulated sugar
¼ cup oil
2 tsps vanilla extract
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tsps baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp ground allspice
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
½ tsp ground ginger
Glaze
⅔ cup powdered sugar, sifted
3 tsps apple or orange juice
Directions
Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly oil a 9-inch round or square baking
dish.
To make the filling, place apples, sugar, cinnamon, and water in a pan
over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10
minutes or until apples and are fork-tender. Remove from heat.
To make the cake, mix applesauce, juice, sugar, oil, and vanilla
together in a small bowl. In a large bowl, whisk together whole wheat
and all-purpose flours, baking powder and soda, salt, cinnamon,
allspice, and ginger. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix until
just combined; the batter will be thick. Don’t overmix or the cake will
be tough and not tender.
Scoop about half of the batter into the prepared pan; spread to cover
the bottom. Spoon ¾ of the apple filling evenly over cake batter.
Scoop remaining batter on top and spread evenly. Distribute
remaining apples on top. Bake for 55 to 65 minutes, or until the center
of the cake is set. Remove from oven and set aside to cool while
making the glaze.
To make the glaze, sift the powdered sugar into a small bowl. Add
juice and stir until smooth. The glaze should be fairly thick or else it
will soak into the cake. When the cake has cooled, drizzle the glaze
over the top of cake. Let the glaze set for about 5 minutes before
serving. Store the cake covered in the refrigerator for several days.
Blueberr Cbble
SERVES 6
Chef Linda: The Betty, the grump, the slump, the dump, the buckle, or the sonker, a cobbler by any
other name would taste just as sweet. A cobbler is a simple, rustic delight that highlights glorious
fresh fruit, like summer’s sweet blueberries, while giving you just enough tender, “cakey” topping to
satisfy the torment of a spoiled sweet tooth. Swapping out dairy-based butter and milk for plantbased ingredients is all that’s necessary to create a vegan version. Use frozen blueberries if you
develop an out-of-season craving. Splendid for breakfast and sublime for dessert with a dollop of our
Coconut Whipped Cream (pg. 223). Just what summer is all about.
Allergens: Contains gluten and ingredients that may contain soy
Ingredients
6 cups fresh blueberries, washed, dried and picked over
2 Tbsps cornstarch
1 Tbsp granulated sugar
1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
Dough
2½ cups all-purpose flour
⅓ cup granulated sugar
1 Tbsp baking powder
1 tsp cinnamon
½ tsp salt
1½ sticks vegan butter, cut into small pieces
1 cup unsweetened nondairy milk
2 tsps vanilla
To Serve
Nondairy vanilla ice cream
Coconut Whipped Cream (pg. 223)
1.
2.
3.
Fresh mint leaves, for garnish
Directions
Preheat oven to 400°F. In a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish, gently toss
the blueberries with the cornstarch, sugar, and lemon juice.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder,
cinnamon, and salt. Add the butter pieces and rub together with your
hands or cut with a pastry blender until it’s the consistency of damp
sand with some pea-sized pieces. Measure the milk and add the
vanilla to the measuring cup, then pour it into the flour. Stir to
combine, without overmixing. The dough should be thick and sticky.
Plop clumps of batter on top of the blueberries, covering the most of
the top but leaving some areas where the blueberries are visible.
Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake for
another 15 to 20 minutes. Cobbler is ready when the blueberries are
bubbling around the edges and the dough is mostly firm to the touch
so check after 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let sit for about 15
minutes before serving.

MAKES 1 (9-INCH) ROUND CAKE, 8 TO 10 SLICES
Chef Linda: This is a cake for the ages. Exceptionally moist, it’s truly something special. Our recipe
proves once again that compassionate confections are made delicious with the simplest substitutions.
Thank the almond paste for the density and elegance of this cake. Praise the delicate raspberries for
the tart accent they contribute. Sigh over the gorgeous pink swirls. And acknowledge that it’s not
necessary to use eggs or dairy to achieve such greatness.
Allergens: Contains gluten, nuts, and ingredients that may contain soy
Special Equipment: Electric mixer (handheld or stand)
Ingredients
5 Tbsps vegan butter, softened, plus extra to butter cake pan
7 ounces almond paste (found in the baking aisle in a tube, can, or box)
½ cup granulated sugar
2 tsps vanilla extract
½ cup unsweetened nondairy milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking powder
¼ tsp salt
1 heaping cup fresh raspberries (or frozen raspberries, thawed)
To Serve
Fresh raspberries
Vanilla ice cream
Coconut Whipped Cream (pg. 223)
Directions
Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly butter a 9-inch round cake pan. Cut
parchment to line the bottom of the pan.
2.

4.
With an electric mixer, cream together the butter and almond paste
until smooth and creamy. Add sugar and vanilla and mix until no
bumps are visible. Add milk and beat until glossy and completely
smooth.
Add the flour to the mixture and sprinkle in the baking powder and
salt. Mix until just combined. Using a spatula, gently fold in the
raspberries. Pour batter into prepared cake pan. Bake for about 40
minutes, until the top of the cake is a dark, golden brown and puffed
up. To ensure it’s done, touch the center of the cake for firmness. It
should not be mushy. If the cake looks very brown and the center is
not done, loosely cover it with foil and bake for another 5 to 10
minutes.
Let the cake cool in the pan for about 30 minutes to an hour before
serving. To serve, run a sharp knife around the edge of the pan. Hold a
serving plate on top of the cake pan and invert to release the cake.
Turn the plate back over and slice to serve. Top with a scoop of ice
cream or coconut whipped cream and a few fresh berries.
Choclat-Coconu Oatmea Cookie
MAKES APPROXIMATELY 16 TO 20 COOKIES
Chef Sara: Sometimes the best things in life are the result of a happy accident—like these cookies!
These cookies were made with some of the odds and ends in my pantry, and these scrumptious
cookies were the result. The slightly chewy texture, gentle sweetness, and chocolatey goodness of
these addictive little gems will make you plan ahead to have all the ingredients available on a snowy
winter’s day.
Allergens: Contains nuts and ingredients that may contain soy
Tip: For a subtle coconut flavor, use unrefined coconut oil. For a neutral flavor, use
refined coconut oil.
Ingredients
1 Tbsp ground flaxseed
3 Tbsps warm water
½ cup coconut oil, melted
½ cup brown sugar
2 Tbsps maple syrup
1 tsp vanilla extract
½ cup almond flour or almond meal
½ cup oat flour
¾ tsp baking powder
½ tsp salt

Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line two baking trays with parchment and
set aside.
In a small bowl, whisk together the flaxseed with the water to make a
“flax egg.” Set aside to thicken for about 5 minutes.
In a large bowl, whisk together the melted coconut oil, brown sugar,
maple syrup, and vanilla. Add the “flax egg” and whisk again until the
mixture is smooth and slightly thickened.
In a medium bowl, stir together the almond flour, oat flour, baking
powder, salt, and cinnamon. Add to the wet ingredients, using a
spatula to stir everything together until no flour is visible. Add the
oats, coconut, and chocolate chips, and stir until everything is wellincorporated. The dough will be a little sticky, but will hold its shape
when scooped.
Use a portion scoop or two spoons to portion out approximate
tablespoon measures of dough onto the prepared baking trays. The
cookies should be about the same size. With wet hands, gently press
each cookie down about halfway, flattening it slightly. Bake for 8 to
10 minutes, rotating the trays halfway through baking, until the
cookies are golden brown around the edges. Remove from the oven
and cool for a few minutes on the trays. Transfer the cookies to a wire
rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room
temperature.

MAKES 24 (2-INCH SQUARE) BROWNIES
Chef Sara: These luscious brownies are dark, rich, and oh-so-chocolatey. They prove, again, that
baking without eggs and dairy is delicious and easy. Using dark chocolate chips yield a less sweet
result, which tastes especially wonderful when served warm with a scoop of your favorite vegan ice
cream.
Allergens: Contains gluten, nuts, and ingredients that may contain soy
Tip: To make these brownies a little sweeter, use vegan semi-sweet chocolate chips
instead of dark chocolate.
Ingredients
¼ cup ground flaxseed
¾ cup warm water
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tsps baking powder
¼ tsp salt
½ cup melted refined coconut oil
1½ cups light brown sugar, packed

Meanwhile, sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt into a
large bowl. Whisk to mix thoroughly.
In medium bowl, add the “flax egg,” melted coconut oil, brown sugar,
almond butter, and vanilla. Whisk until the ingredients are completely
incorporated and somewhat thickened. Pour the wet ingredients into
the dry ingredients, and stir together with a spatula or wooden spoon
until there’s no trace of flour left. Stir in the chocolate chips.
Scrape the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth out the top.
Transfer to the preheated oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the
edges are dry and pulling away from the pan, and the center is set, but
still a bit soft. The brownies will firm up as they cool.
Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes. Slice

MAKES ONE (9-INCH) PIE, 8 TO 12 SERVINGS
Chef Sara: this decadent pie is a coconut lover’s dream! Whenever we serve this at our staff lunches,
it’s gobbled up immediately. A homemade graham cracker and coconut crust encases a creamy
coconut custard filling. Then it’s topped with sweet coconut whipped cream and toasted shredded
coconut. Agar flakes behave like a vegan gelatin, thickening the filling so the pie slices beautifully.
Allergens: Contains gluten and ingredients that may contain soy
Special Equipment: Food processor (to make graham cracker crumbs)
Make Ahead: Pie crust can be made a 1 or 2 days in advance.
Tip: Find agar online or in well-stocked natural food stores. Nabisco’s regular graham
crackers are vegan.
Ingredients
Pie Crust
1 cup vegan, graham cracker crumbs, from approximately 5–7 graham crackers, depending on the
brand
½ cup unsweetened shredded coconut
2 Tbsps granulated sugar
4 Tbsps vegan butter, melted
Filling
1 Tbsp agar flakes
½ cup water
1 (13.5 ounce) can regular (not light) coconut milk
½ cup unsweetened nondairy milk
½ cup granulated sugar
Pinch of salt
¼ cup cornstarch
1 tsp vanilla extract
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
Coconut Whipped Cream (pg. 223)
Toasted shredded coconut, for garnish
Directions
To make the pie crust, preheat the oven to 325°F. Pulse graham
crackers in a food processor until finely ground. In a medium bowl,
combine graham cracker crumbs, coconut, sugar, and melted butter,
and mix well until it barely holds together when pressed between your
fingers.
Lightly grease a 9-inch pie plate, and spread the crust mixture evenly
over the bottom and sides. Press it down evenly and firmly into the
pie plate, using your fingers or the bottom of a measuring cup,
covered with plastic wrap to prevent sticking. Be sure to press firmly,
especially up the sides. This will ensure a stable crust. Prick the crust
several times with a fork, including along the sides.
Bake at 325°F for 12 to 15 minutes, until golden brown. If the crust
has puffed up a bit during baking, gently press it down with a spatula
to compact it. Cool completely before filling.
To make the filling, combine agar flakes and water in a small pot and
let sit for about 10 minutes to soften. Bring the mixture to a boil,
cover, and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the agar is completely
dissolved.
While the agar mixture is simmering, combine the coconut milk,
nondairy milk, granulated sugar, and salt in a medium pot. Whisk in
the cornstarch and bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking
frequently to prevent sticking. After coming to a boil, the mixture will
be the texture of a thin pudding. Stir in the vanilla extract, shredded
coconut, and agar mixture. Mix well.
Pour the coconut custard into the prepared pie crust, smoothing out
the top with the back of a spoon. Refrigerate for at least four hours,
until set. To decorate the pie, spread or pipe coconut whipped cream
over the pie surface and sprinkle with toasted coconut. To slice easily,
dip a sharp knife in hot water, wipe with a clean cloth, and slice.
Repeat for each slice for beautiful, clean slices.

MAKES 1 (9-INCH) PIE
Chef Linda: Are there any words that bring more joy to the soul than chocolate mousse? Actually,
yes: Vegan chocolate mousse! No eggs or milk in this compassionate version, and yet it’s still
impossibly rich, dark, and creamy. Our recipe, originally developed for a Sanctuary cooking class on
no-bake desserts, uses heart-healthy avocados to create a silky filling. Don’t be alarmed by the use of
tamari and balsamic vinegar; good chocolate has complex flavors, and these two ingredients
contribute to them. And oh, the crust! Dates, nuts, and chocolate chips work magic to create a simple
gluten-free and healthy crust. You will need seconds, maybe even thirds.
Allergens: Contains nuts, soy, and ingredients that may contain gluten
Special Equipment: Food processor
Tip: Use raw cacao powder in place of cocoa powder for a dose of powerful
antioxidants (forty times more than blueberries!).
Ingredients
Crust
1½ cups raw pecans
½ cup vegan chocolate chips
¼ tsp salt
1 cup pitted dates, about 10 to 12, roughly chopped and soaked in hot water for about 5 minutes
Chocolate Mousse
3 large avocados
¾ cup cocoa powder
½ cup + 1 Tbsp maple syrup
⅓ cup coconut cream
2 Tbsps tamari or soy sauce
1 Tbsp + 1 tsp balsamic vinegar
2 tsps vanilla extract
1.
2.
To Serve
Coconut Whipped Cream (pg. 223)
Directions
To make the crust, add the pecans, chocolate chips, and salt to a food
processor and pulse until mixture is ground but still retains some
medium chunks of chips and nuts. Drain the dates, squeezing out
excess water, and add to the food processor. Pulse until everything is
combined. Empty mixture into a 9-inch pie plate and press firmly up
the sides and on the bottom. Finish by pressing firmly all the way
around using the bottom of a metal measuring cup. Wash the food
processor bowl.
To make the chocolate mousse, combine all the filling ingredients in
the food processor and blend until creamy and smooth, scraping down
the sides as necessary. Empty the filling into the prepared crust and
spread evenly. Freeze for 2 to 3 hours. To serve, let pie sit out for
about 15 to 20 minutes before slicing and serving alongside coconut
whipped cream.
Avocad Ke Lim Pi
MAKES 1 (9-INCH) PIE
Chef Linda: Sweet and tart key lime pie originated in the south where these small limes grow in
abundance. Reminiscent of long and lazy summer days, this pie is a seasonal favorite. We gave this
beloved dessert a compassionate makeover for our Sanctuary cooking class and kept the best parts—
the creamy texture, lip-puckering taste, and crumbly crust. The unkind ingredients were easily
replaced. It’s just another example of how we can reinvent our favorite foods and never miss a beat.
Make this simple pie when you need a little slice of heaven or when you want to share the joy of
eating vegan with others.
Allergens: Contains gluten and ingredients that may contain soy
Special Equipment: Food processor
Make Ahead: Pie needs to chill for several hours before eating.
Ingredients
Crust
1½ cups vegan graham cracker crumbs, from about 9–13 graham crackers
8 Tbsps vegan butter, melted (or 8 Tbsps melted coconut oil and ⅛ tsp salt)
Filling
1 cup canned coconut cream
¼ cup cornstarch
2 avocados, pitted
½ cup + 1 Tbsp maple syrup
1 Tbsp lime zest, plus 1 tsp for garnish

To serve
Coconut Whipped Cream (pg. 223)
Directions
To make the crust, break the graham crackers into the bowl of a food
processor. Pulse to grind into fine crumbs. Add the melted butter and
pulse until the mixture resembles wet sand. Empty crumbs into a 9-
inch pie plate and press firmly up the sides and on the bottom. Finish
by pressing firmly all the way around using the bottom of a metal
measuring cup. Wash the food processor bowl.
To make the filling, place all the ingredients in a blender or food
processor. Blend until completely smooth. Empty mixture into a small
pot. Cook over low-medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture
thickens and begins to make big, gloppy bubbles, about 8 minutes.
Empty the filling into the prepared crust and spread evenly. Garnish
with lime zest. Freeze for several hours and bring to room temperature

MAKES 1 (9-INCH) PIE
Chef Linda: Spiced just right with aromatic cinnamon, ginger, and cloves, this pie is a healthy
alternative to most holiday desserts and the only pumpkin pie recipe you’ll ever need. The crust is a
simple and nourishing blend of dried fruit and nuts, perfect for everyone, including your gluten-free
guests. Without eggs, cornstarch is all you need to thicken the filling. A few minutes on the stovetop
activates the starch and makes for a rich pie after it is chilled. We demonstrated this pie at our annual
Thanksgiving event, and even the confirmed pumpkin-pie-haters asked for the recipe. With every
bite, this pie will inspire compassionate eating at your holiday table.
Allergens: Contains nuts
Special Equipment: Food processor and blender
Make Ahead: Bake squash 1 or 2 days in advance for easy assembly. The entire pie
can be made 1 day in advance.
Tip: We use kabocha squash (also called buttercup squash) instead of fresh pumpkin
because of its low moisture content, gentle sweetness, and lack of stringiness.
Ingredients
Crust
1½ cups walnuts
1 heaping cup pitted, chopped dates, about 10 to 12
¼ cup dried cranberries
¼ cup dried, chopped figs
½ tsp vanilla extract
⅛ tsp salt
Filling
2 cups cooked kabocha/buttercup squash from a 1½ pound squash (or canned pumpkin)
1½ cups regular canned coconut milk
⅓ cup maple syrup
1.
2.
3.
2 Tbsps cornstarch
1 tsp vanilla extract
1½ tsps ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground ginger
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp ground cloves
To Serve
Coconut Whipped Cream (pg. 223)
Directions
To cook the squash, place the whole squash on a baking tray in an
oven heated to 375°F. Bake for about 45 to 60 minutes, or until a
sharp knife can be easily inserted. When the squash is cool, cut it in
half. Scoop out and discard the seeds.
To make the crust, place all of the ingredients in a food processor.
Pulse, stopping occasionally to scrape the sides, until the nuts are
finely chopped, the ingredients are blended, and the mixture holds
together when pinched. Empty into a 9-inch pie plate. Firmly press
crust mixture onto the bottom and the sides of the pie plate. Use the
bottom of a metal measuring cup to smooth.
To make the filling, place all the ingredients in a blender and blend
until smooth. Pour the mixture into a medium pot and cook over‐
medium-low heat, stirring continuously, until it starts to thicken. This
should take 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Pour the filling into
the crust. Carefully cover with plastic wrap without letting the wrap
touch the filling. Refrigerate for several hours or overnight. Slice and
serve with coconut whipped cream.

MAKES ONE 9-INCH PIE, ABOUT 8 TO 12 SERVINGS
Chef Sara: Apple pie, made from scratch and with love, is humble and heavenly, simple and
sophisticated, classic and modern. It goes without saying that local, in-season apples make the best
pie, but don’t lose hope if apple season is over; buy what’s available. One surefire way to ensure a
delicious pie is to use several varieties of apples at once—Granny Smith, Macintosh, Empire,
Jonathan, Cortland, and Golden Delicious. This classic recipe is adapted from a King Arthur Flour
recipe.
Allergens: Contains gluten and ingredients that may contain soy
Ingredients
2 pie crusts, one fitted into 9-inch pie plate, the other rolled out and chilled (see our recipe on pg. 209
or purchase store-bought vegan crusts)
2 pounds apples, about 5–7 apples, preferably a mix of varieties, peeled, cored, and sliced, about 6
cups
2 Tbsps lemon juice
½–⅔ cup granulated sugar (use the larger quantity if your apples are tart)
2 Tbsps all-purpose flour
1 Tbsp cornstarch
½ tsp ground cinnamon
¼ tsp ground nutmeg
¼ tsp ground allspice
¼ cup apple cider or water
Nondairy milk for brushing crust
Turbinado or coarse sugar for sprinkling on the crust (optional)
Directions
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Place the pie plate fitted with the crust on a
baking tray so you can easily transfer it to the oven.
2.
3.
4.
In a large bowl, toss together the apples and lemon juice. Add the
sugar, flour, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice, and gently
mix until the fruit is evenly coated. Stir in the apple cider or water and
transfer the filling to the prepared pie crust.
Cover the filling with the remaining crust, and cut five or six slits in
the center of the dough to allow for airflow during baking. For a fun
crust, cut out small shapes using a decorative cutter. Save the little cut
outs and place them whimsically around the top of the crust. Crimp
the edges together to seal. Alternatively, make a lattice crust. Using a
pastry wheel, cut long strips of dough from the remaining pie crust
and arrange in a lattice pattern. Trim the edges of the dough with
scissors and crimp the two crusts together to seal. Brush the crust with
a light, even coat of nondairy milk, and sprinkle with the optional
turbinado sugar for a sweet and sparkly finish.
Place the baking tray in the oven and bake for 45 to 55 minutes, until
the crust is golden-brown and the filling is thickened and bubbling.
Remove, allow to cool on a wire rack, then serve.

MAKES ONE (9-INCH) PIE CRUST
Chef Sara: Making pastry from scratch can feel intimidating, but it doesn’t have to be! This recipe is
an old favorite that yields a delicious pie crust that works perfectly for just about any pie. The tricks
for achieving a tender, flaky crust include keeping your ingredients cold, using a light hand when
mixing, and allowing the dough to rest.
Allergens: Contains gluten and ingredients that may contain soy
Special Equipment: Food processor, optional
Make Ahead: Dough needs to rest for at least 30 minutes before rolling. It can be
made several days in advance.
Tip: If using this to make a savory crust, omit the sugar.
Ingredients
1½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling
1 Tbsp granulated sugar
¼ tsp salt (if using coconut oil instead of vegan butter, add an additional ¼ tsp salt)
½ cup (8 Tbsps) vegan butter or refined coconut oil, chilled
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
¼ cup + 2 Tbsps ice water, plus more as needed
Directions
In a medium-large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt, and whisk
together to mix. Use two knives or a pastry cutter to cut the cold
vegan butter into ¼-inch cubes, add to the bowl, and place the bowl in
the freezer to chill for 10 minutes. Alternatively, chill in the
refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to several hours.
2.
3.
4.
Using either a pastry cutter or two knives, cut the vegan butter into the
flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of small pebbles.
Alternatively, use a food processor, pulsing a few times until the
shortening pieces are the desired size. Be very careful not to allow the
dough to gather up into a ball; overworking the dough will result in
tough pastry. Mix together the apple cider vinegar and ice water in a
small bowl, then pour over the crumbly dough, mixing together gently
with a fork until the dough just holds together. Add in extra ice water
as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, if the dough is too dry.
Flour a work surface, gather the dough into a ball, and transfer to the
floured surface. Pat the dough out into a rough circle approximately 5
to 6 inches across, then wrap the disc in plastic wrap, place in the
refrigerator, and allow to chill for at least 1 hour or up to a few days.
(The dough can also be frozen at this point, for later use.) Chilling the
dough allows the gluten to relax, which will make the crust more
tender.
When you’re ready to roll the crust, flour a large piece of parchment,
unwrap the chilled dough, and place the disc on the floured
parchment. Sprinkle some more flour on top of the disc, then use a
rolling pin to roll the dough out into a circle that’s a several inches
larger than your pie plate. Place the pie plate with the open surface
flush against the rolled out crust, then, with one hand under the
parchment and one securing the pie plate, flip everything over so the
crust is sitting atop the pie plate. Gently peel off the parchment, press
the crust down into the pie dish, and trim the edges. Decoratively
crimp the edge however you like, or leave the edge plain if using a
double or lattice crust later, and proceed with your recipe.

creative, and substitute any other gorgeous, ripe summer fruits such as peaches, blackberries,
raspberries, blueberries, or petite red currants.

¼ tsp salt
Custard
1 (13.5-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk

Fruit Topping
2 pounds summer fruit of your choice, in whatever combination you like
¼ cup apricot or peach preserves, warmed in the microwave or on the stovetop (optional)
Directions
To make the crust, start by preheating the oven to 350°F. Lightly oil
the tart pan and set aside until needed.
Place the oats in the bowl of a food processor and process for at least
one or two minutes, until the oats have been ground into a flour. Add
the pecans, and pulse a few times until the pecans are finely ground
and incorporated, but not oily. Add the coconut oil, maple syrup, and
salt, and pulse again until the mixture holds together. It will be bit
sticky, but will hold together when pressed.
Transfer the mixture into the prepared tart pan, and use your fingers to
spread it evenly across the bottom and sides of the pan, pressing
firmly. Prick the crust evenly with a fork, then place in the preheated
oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned. Set aside to
cool.
To make the custard, combine the coconut milk, nondairy milk, sugar,
vanilla bean seeds or extract, cornstarch, salt, and turmeric in a
medium saucepan over medium-low heat, whisking to combine. Use a
rubber spatula to stir the mixture slowly and evenly as it cooks to
prevent scorching. Cook until the custard is thick and bubbling, about
7 minutes. To keep the cornstarch from breaking down and thinning
out the custard, remove from the heat as soon as the custard is
thickened and bubbling. Pour the custard into a bowl, cover the
surface of the custard with plastic wrap to prevent a film from
forming, and chill until cold, at least two hours. Overnight is fine.
To assemble the fruit topping, begin by preparing your chosen fruit.
For small berries, simply rinse, pat dry, and use them whole.
Strawberries can be used whole if small, or sliced if larger. Nectarines

and plums don’t need to be peeled, just pitted and sliced. Because of
their fuzzy skins, peaches are best peeled and then pitted and sliced.
Regardless of which fruits you’re using, prepare them before
assembly and place them near your workstation.
Whisk the chilled custard to smooth it out, adding 1 tablespoon at a
time of milk if the custard is too thick to spread. Spoon into the cooled
crust and spread it evenly with a spatula. Arrange your prepared fruits
across the top of the custard in whatever design you like. To give the
tart a beautiful shine, use a pastry brush or crumpled paper towel to
dab the warmed apricot or peach jam onto the top of the fruits, coating
each piece.
For best results, serve within a few hours. Leftovers won’t be as
beautiful, but they will still taste delicious!

Chef Linda: Pound cake received its name from very practical origins—the recipe called for a pound
each of flour, butter, sugar, and eggs. And while this version tastes old fashioned—just the way it
should—it uses no butter or eggs. We developed this recipe for a group of college students
volunteering at the Sanctuary on their winter break to create a teaching moment about the tragic lives
of dairy cows and egg-laying hens. Thankfully, everyone else who’s enjoyed this cake over the years
now knows that we can create our favorite foods without harming animals. This is a cake to savor:

Chef Linda: No one should have to do without cheesecake—ever! Smooth and rich, this cheesecake
boasts compassion and nutrition as two of its main ingredients, something regular cheesecake can’t
do. Macadamia and cashews blend beautifully to create a creamy base. And is there anything a
chickpea can’t do? In this recipe, chickpeas create a dense texture and a complex taste than you
wouldn’t get with nuts alone. A simple graham cracker crust works beautifully (Nabisco’s regular
graham crackers are accidentally vegan), as does the gluten-free version that uses ground almonds
and a little granulated sugar. The light, crumbly crust takes only minutes to make. The filling needs
only a blender to create. And the salted caramel is optional, but more than worth it.

¾ tsp salt
Salted Caramel Sauce
1 cup brown sugar, packed
6 Tbsps vegan butter, cut into chunks
½ cup canned coconut milk
2 tsps vanilla extract
¼ tsp coarse salt
To Serve
Flaked salt (optional)
Directions
Preheat oven to 325°F. Trace the bottom of the springform pan onto
parchment and cut it out. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment
circle and lightly oil the sides with butter. Line a baking tray with
parchment and place the pan on top; this will make clean up easier.
To make the crust, break the graham crackers into a food processor
and blend until finely ground. Add melted butter and pulse until the
mixture resembles wet sand. Empty the crumbs into the springform
pan and firmly press them evenly into the bottom and up the sides.
To make the filling, place all the ingredients in a high-speed blender.
Blend, while scraping down sides occasionally, for about 2 minutes,
or until completely smooth and creamy. There should be no gritty
texture in the mixture.
To assemble the cake, pour the filling into the springform pan. Set the
oven rack in the bottom position. Place the pan on a baking tray lined
with parchment and put in the oven. Bake for about 50 minutes. If you

notice the top is browning too much, place a piece of foil over the top
of the pan without touching the filling.
To make the salted caramel sauce, place the sugar in a small, heavybottomed pot. Heat over medium- high heat, while stirring
occasionally. As the sugar heats, it will begin to melt and darken.
When that starts to happen, you’ll need to stir it more frequently.
Once the sugar is completely dissolved, remove the pot from heat and
stir in the butter. When the butter is melted, place the pot back on the
heat and stir in the milk. Cook, while stirring, until the mixture just
starts to bubble. Keep cooking for about 1 minute after the initial boil,
then remove from heat. Stir in vanilla and salt and set aside to cool.
The cake is done when it is mostly firm to the touch around the outer
perimeter with a slightly less done center. It will firm up further when
cooled completely. Remove the cake from oven and let cool on the
counter before putting it into the refrigerator to chill for several hours
or overnight.
To serve, cut slices and place on plates. Drizzle with salted caramel
sauce and sprinkle with flaked salt. Extra caramel sauce can be stored
in a sealed container for up to one month.

trawberr-Peca Thumbprin Cookie
MAKES APPROXIMATELY 2 DOZEN COOKIES
Chef Sara: This vegan spin on classic thumbprint cookies tastes much richer than the sum of its
parts, thanks to the chopped pecans that toast in the oven as the cookies bake. Classic strawberry is
our favorite filling here, but you can substitute your favorite sweet and sticky jam or jelly.
Allergens: Contains nuts
Special Equipment: Electric mixer
Tip: For a subtle coconut flavor, use unrefined coconut oil. For a neutral flavor, use
refined coconut oil.
Ingredients
1 Tbsp ground flaxseed
3 Tbsps warm water
½ cup coconut oil, softened
½ cup coconut sugar or granulated sugar (coconut sugar adds a subtle caramel flavor)
1 tsp vanilla extract
1¼ cups gluten-free flour blend
¼ tsp salt
1½ cups finely chopped pecans
½ cup strawberry preserves or fruit spread
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two baking trays with parchment or
silicone baking mats.
In a small bowl, mix together the ground flaxseed and warm water to
make a “flax egg.” Allow to sit for about 5 minutes to thicken.
3.
4.
5.
Meanwhile, use an electric mixer to beat together the coconut oil and
coconut sugar until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and “flax egg”
and beat again until well-combined. Add the flour and salt to the
bowl, and mix on low speed until incorporated. Stay on low speed, or
use a spatula and work by hand to mix in the chopped pecans. The
dough will be slightly soft and sticky.
Use two spoons or a small portion scoop to portion out approximate
tablespoon measures of dough. Gently roll each ball between your
palms to smooth them, then place on the prepared baking trays, at
least 1 inch apart. Use the palm of your hand to slightly flatten each
dough ball, then use your thumb, a soup spoon, or a measuring spoon
to make an indentation in the center of each cookie. If the spoon
you’re using is sticking, periodically dip it in warm water as you work
to prevent sticking. Fill each indentation with a small amount of
preserves. Try to keep the preserves level with the top of the
indentation to prevent overflow.
Transfer to the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the cookies
are lightly browned and the pecans smell toasty. Cool briefly on the
baking trays, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.

Chew Choclat Gingerbrea Cookie
MAKES 2 DOZEN COOKIES
Chef Sara: These chewy, slightly spicy, and just-sweet-enough cookies are adapted from a favorite
recipe by Martha Stewart, and they’re beloved by cooking class students and Sanctuary staff alike. In
fact, after taking the photos for this recipe during our cookbook photo shoot, these cookies were
gobbled up in record time! You’ll love their crunchy sugary coating and warm, gingery bite of these
special cookies.
Allergens: Contains gluten and ingredients that may contain soy
Special Equipment: Electric mixer recommended
Make Ahead: Dough can be made the day before, then shaped and baked.
Ingredients
1½ cups whole wheat pastry flour
1 Tbsp cocoa powder
1 Tbsp ground ginger
1½ tsps ground cinnamon
¼ tsp ground nutmeg
Pinch of ground cloves
8 Tbsps (1 stick) vegan butter (or solid, refined coconut oil and ½ tsp salt)
½ cup brown sugar, packed
¼ cup unsulfured molasses
2 Tbsps nondairy milk
1 tsp baking soda
⅔ cup vegan chocolate chips
¼ cup granulated sugar, for coating
Directions
Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line two baking trays with parchment.

4.
5.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa, ginger, cinnamon,
nutmeg, and cloves.
In another medium bowl, use an electric mixer to beat together the
vegan butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the molasses
and nondairy milk to the butter and sugar, and beat until well
incorporated. Dissolve the baking soda in 1 tablespoon hot water, then
add to the bowl with the vegan butter and brown sugar and mix well.
Add half the dry ingredients to the wet and mix together on low speed
until well incorporated. Add the remaining flour mixture, then use a
spatula to mix the batter until there’s no flour visible. Fold in the
chocolate chips. The dough will be sticky, but not overly wet.
Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour to make scooping and rolling
easier.
Using a measuring spoon or a small scoop, portion out generous
tablespoon-sized balls of dough, roll between your hands to smooth
them, and then roll each ball of dough in the sugar. Place the sugarcoated cookies on the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least two
inches between cookies, and flatten them slightly with your hands.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until barely set and lightly cracked on the
surface. These cookies firm up when they cool, so aim for a slightly
undercooked texture. Allow to cool for a few minutes on the baking
tray, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.
Choclat Chi Cooki Doug Truf le
MAKES 18 TO 20 BITE-SIZED TRUFFLES
Chef Sara: Whether at a special event, staff lunch, or cooking class, these truffles have always been
a crowd-pleasing and compassionate indulgence that are deceptively simple to make. They’ll remind
you of sneaking bites of raw cookie dough from the bowl as a kid, but because they’re egg-free,
they’re completely safe to eat without any baking.
Allergens: Contains nuts and ingredients that may contain soy
Make Ahead: Truffle filling needs to chill for at least 30 minutes before dipping, or
make it 1 day in advance.
Variation: To make coconut rum truffles, follow the same procedure but substitute ¼
cup coconut nectar for the maple syrup, 3 tablespoons coconut rum for the vanilla,
and ½ cup + 2 tablespoons toasted unsweetened coconut for the mini chocolate
chips. Garnish each coated truffle with a sprinkling of toasted coconut and chill until
serving time.
Ingredients
Truffles
1½ cups almond meal
½ tsp salt
¼ cup maple syrup
¼ cup melted coconut oil
1½ tsps vanilla extract
1⁄3 cup vegan mini chocolate chips
Chocolate Coating
1 cup vegan dark chocolate chips
2 tsps coconut oil, melted
Directions

3.
To make the truffles, mix together the almond meal, salt, and maple
syrup until well incorporated. Add the melted coconut oil and vanilla
extract and mix well to form a sticky dough. Add the chocolate chips
and mix to incorporate.
Shape the dough into teaspoon-sized balls using a small scoop or two
spoons and place on a parchment-lined plate or tray. Freeze for at least
30 minutes, until firm.
To make the chocolate coating, melt the dark chocolate chips and
coconut oil together. Roll each truffle between your hands to smooth
them, dip in the melted chocolate, using a fork to lift out each coated
truffle. Place the coated truffles back on the parchment, and
refrigerate until ready to serve. These will soften a bit at room
temperature but are at their best served slightly chilled.

N-Bak Choclat Peanu But e Bar
MAKES ONE 9-INCH SQUARE PAN (16 TO 20 BARS)
Chef Sara: These fudgy, chocolate and peanut butter layered bars are irresistible! They come
together quickly and require no baking. Children may prefer semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of
dark chocolate, which yields a slightly sweeter result.
Allergens: Contains peanuts and ingredients that may contain soy
Ingredients
1½ sticks (¾ cup) vegan butter
½ cup brown sugar, firmly packed
1 tsp vanilla extract
3 cups quick oats
1 cup vegan dark chocolate chips
1 cup smooth, unsalted peanut butter
¼ tsp salt
Directions
Butter an 8-inch square baking pan, and set aside until needed.
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the brown
sugar and the vanilla. Add the oats, reduce the heat to medium-low,
and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently.
In another pot, place the chocolate chips, peanut butter, and salt and
allow to melt over low heat, stirring frequently to prevent scorching.
The mixture is ready when the chocolate is completely melted, with
no visible chocolate pieces.
4.
5.
Spoon ⅔ of the oat mixture into the prepared baking pan, covering the
bottom of the pan evenly. Use a spatula to firmly and evenly press the
mixture into the pan. The more firmly the oats are pressed, the more
stable the crust will be. Pour the chocolate–peanut butter mixture over
the oat crust, smoothing it out with the back of a spoon. Finally,
sprinkle the remaining oat mixture over the chocolate, pressing it
gently into the chocolate.
Transfer to the refrigerator, and chill for at least three hours or
overnight. Allow to sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes before
cutting and serving. Leftovers are best kept refrigerated, then brought
out again when needed.

Coconu Whippe Crea
MAKES ABOUT 1 HEAPING CUP
Chef Linda: Let’s be honest . . . isn’t everything better with a little whipped cream? This simple
recipe works just like using dairy-based heavy cream, but uses thick coconut cream instead. If you
find a brand that works well for you, buy several cans so you’ll always have a batch on hand for
whenever you need a gentle touch of heavenly sweetness.
Make Ahead: Chill the coconut cream for several hours first. The finished whipped
cream will firm as it chills, so it’s ideal to make this recipe 1 hour before you need it.
Ingredients
1 (14-ounce) can coconut cream, chilled
½ cup powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla
Pinch of salt
Directions
Scoop out chilled coconut cream into metal bowl. Sift in powdered
sugar and add vanilla and salt. Using an electric mixer, whip the
coconut cream until smooth. Serve immediately or chill before
serving. Chilling the whipped cream will make it thicker. Extra cream
will keep in the refrigerator for several days.
Rea Dea Vega Cannl
MAKES 25 TO 30 CANNOLI
Chef Linda :“OMG!” “No way!” “These can’t be vegan!” These comments are all from disbelieving
participants in a Compassionate Cuisine Italian cooking class after tasting the grand finale: vegan
cannoli that taste like the “real deal.” Blistered and crunchy outer shells filled with creamy goodness,
perfect cannoli are the stuff dreams are made of. To make them without a ricotta cheese filling—and
without tofu—required a fair amount of trial and error before landing on a most unusual solution:
baked potatoes. Fluffy, white, and mild, potatoes provide the right texture and neutral flavor to create
the gently sweetened and imperceptibly tangy experience. You don’t need a culinary degree to make
these, just a little patience.
Allergens: Contains gluten, nuts, and ingredients that may contain soy
Special Equipment: Metal cannoli tubes, food thermometer (optional, but advised),
food processor, rolling pin or pasta machine, and a 3-inch round cookie cutter
Make Ahead: Filling and dough for the shells can be made 1 day in advance.
Tip: If you’re working without a food thermometer, it’s been said that a 1-inch cube of
bread dropped in the right temperature oil will take 60 seconds to brown. A 3-inch
round, thin-rimmed glass will work in place of a cookie cutter.
Ingredients
Shells
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling
3 Tbsps granulated sugar
2 tsps unsweetened cocoa powder
½ tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp salt
½ cup apple juice
3 Tbsps mild-flavored oil
2 tsps apple cider vinegar
½ tsp almond extract
1.
2.
3.
1 quart sunflower seed oil, for frying
Filling
2 large Russet/baking potatoes, about 1½ pounds, baked, still warm
1 Tbsp vegan butter
1 cup powdered sugar
1 heaping Tbsp canned coconut cream
¼ tsp salt
¼ cup mini semi-sweet vegan chocolate chips (optional)
To Decorate
1 cup finely chopped pistachios
½ cup semi-sweet vegan chocolate chips
Powdered sugar
Directions
To make the shells, start by making the dough. Mix the flour, sugar,
cocoa powder, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl. Create a well in
the middle and add apple juice, oil, vinegar, and almond extract. Stir
to combine. When dough starts to come together, turn out onto a
lightly floured surface and knead for several minutes until smooth and
elastic. Wrap in plastic and let rest 30 minutes.
To make the filling, scoop the warm potato flesh from its skin into the
bowl of a food processor. Add the butter, powdered sugar, coconut
cream, and salt. Blend until the mixture is creamy and smooth. Add
the chocolate chips and pulse once or twice to combine. Refrigerate
for about 30 minutes.
To make the shells, heat the oil slowly to 375°F in a heavy bottomed
pot. The oil should be about 4 inches deep. While the oil is heating,
divide the dough into 4 pieces. Lightly flour the counter. Working
with one piece and keeping the others wrapped in plastic, press dough
into a flat rectangle, about ½ inch thick. Using a rolling pin, roll the
dough until it is about the thickness of a dime. Alternatively, pass
dough through the widest setting of a pasta machine, continuing to
4.

pass through narrower settings until desired thickness is achieved. Use
a 3-inch cookie cutter to cut rounds from the dough.
Carefully wrap each round of dough around a cannoli mold. Use a
little water on the edge to gently seal the edge shut and to assure it
won’t fall off during frying. With your finger, gently flare out the top
and bottom edges ever-so-slightly from the mold. This will help you
remove the dough from the tube after frying.
Use a pair of tongs to submerge the cannoli mold in the hot oil. Fry
the shell in the oil until crispy, about 1½ minutes, turning it to ensure
even browning. Remove from the oil with tongs and let the oil drip
back into pot before setting it down on a paper towel–lined plate to
cool.
When the cannoli tube has cooled enough to touch it, gently slide the
cooked cannoli off and set aside on the paper towel to cool
completely. It may take a little pressure to get the cannoli free from
the tube, so push it down from the top rather than gripping the whole
thing so as not to crush the bubbles in the fried dough. Wipe the
cannoli tube to remove excess oil before using again for the next
cannoli.
To decorate, line a baking tray with parchment. Place chopped
pistachios in a small bowl. Melt the chocolate chips in a microwave or
double boiler. Dip the ends of the cannoli shell, one side at a time, into
the melted chocolate to coat the edges. Place the chocolate-dipped
ends into the bowl of ground pistachios, then place them on a piece of
parchment. Let the chocolate harden for about 10 minutes, then the
cannoli will be ready to be filled. Note that to keep the shells crisp, it
is best to fill them fairly close to serving time. You can also omit the
melted chocolate and just sprinkle the chopped pistachios after filling
them.
8. To fill the cannoli, scoop the chilled filling into a ziplock bag or a
pastry bag with a ½-inch star or round tip. If using a ziplock baggie,
fill with about ½ the filling. Snip off one corner so the opening is
about ½-inch wide. Holding the cannoli shell in one hand, and the
baggie or pastry bag in the other, squeeze gently and pipe the filling
into one side of the shell, about halfway through. Switch sides and
pipe filling into the other half so the entire shell is filled. Chill for 15
to 30 minutes and serve dusted with powdered sugar.

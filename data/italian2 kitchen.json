Crespelle ripiene
Filled crepes
INGREDIENTS
For the crespelle batter
½ cup unbleached all-purpose flour
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup whole milk,
1 pinch of salt
6 thin slices Fontina cheese
6 thin slices prosciutto cotto (Italian ham)
For the Béchamel sauce
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour
2 cups whole milk
1 pinch ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
grated Parmigiano Reggiano, to sprinkle
DIRECTIONS
Prepare the crespelle by whisking flour, eggs, milk and salt together to form
a smooth batter. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Heat a small skillet or
crêpe pan and, when very hot, brush it lightly with melted butter. Pour
about ¼ cup of batter into the pan, tilting the skillet to coat the pan evenly.
Cook until it is golden brown on the bottom and the top begins to dry up.
Carefully flip the crespella with a spatula and cook the other side for 30
seconds. Repeat using all the remaining batter. Fill the crespelle with 1 slice
of Fontina and 1 slice of prosciutto cotto. Roll up the crespelle around the
filling and line them up onto a greased baking dish. Preheat the oven at 350º
F. Prepare the  Béchamel  sauce by heating the butter until melted, then
remove from heat, add the flour and stir until smooth and pale
yellow. Slowly pour in the scalded milk, whisking constantly. Put back over
low heat. Bring to a boil then add the nutmeg and stir until just thickened.
Pour the Béchamel sauce over the crespelle, add little pieces of butter all
over the top, sprinkle with grated Parmigiano Reggiano and bake for 20
minutes or until lightly browned on top. Serve the crespelle right away.
*Nonna Fernanda’s Tip: try filling the crespelle in different ways (ricotta
and spinach or Italian sausage and mushrooms or radicchio and gorgonzola
cheese).

with a potato ricer. In a large bowl, place the flour, make a well in the center
then add the mashed potatoes, 1 egg and salt. Knead all the ingredients with
your hands until well blended (add a little more flour if the dough sticks to
your hands). Transfer the dough on a floured work surface, shape the dough
into 3/4-inch diameter logs then cut them into 1-inch long pieces. Drop the
gnocchi into a large pot of boiling salted water and cook until they rise to
the top (usually 1 minute). Remove the gnocchi quickly with a skimmer,

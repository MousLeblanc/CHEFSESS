The Importance of Nutrition
DR. WALTER WILLETT
Frederick John Stare Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition at
the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health
The first question an individual must ask in setting up a dysphagia kitchen
is this: What are you going to eat?
The answer is simple: lean protein, a variety of fruit and vegetables, good
carbohydrates, good fats, low-sodium foods, and low-sugar foods. Missing
from this list are junk food and highly processed foods.
The good news is that the choices for healthy eating are under the control of
those who have dysphagia, their families, and their caregivers. Nutrition is
the most overlooked element of maintaining general good health, a good
immune system, and quality of life.
My research on choosing foods with the best types of carbohydrates, fats,
and proteins, and on the relative importance of various food groups and
supplements, informs Cooking for Dysphagia and Other Swallowing
Disorders. Diane has built on this research to help anyone facing a
diagnosis of dysphagia ensure that they or their loved one is able to
maintain and enjoy a healthy eating plan.
Diane has laid out in an easy-to-use fashion how to plan for the transition to
a pureed diet, with excellent recipes and helpful techniques that make it
easy to get food on the table. She incorporates expert advice from
dysphagia experts to help with this transition as well.
Cooking for Dysphagia and Other Swallowing Disorders is an important
and useful book for all who are dealing with this condition, and one I highly
recommend.

Introduction
I had been cooking for my mom for two years when she was diagnosed
with dysphagia, a swallowing disorder, along with the onset of dementia.
Boom! Once the diagnosis was made, every meal from that point forward
had to be pureed, and every beverage, including liquid medicines, needed to
be of the prescribed consistency. I had to put food on the table that night.
What was I to do? My mother had to eat, or she would lose weight, lose
immune function, and decline in health.
The transition to a dysphagia kitchen is a huge adjustment for you or your
loved one and the whole family. My sister, a registered nurse, recommended
baby food, but baby food is not nutritious enough for an adult. I checked the
pharmacy where I bought thickener. The food that was available
commercially was canned or vacuum-packed and not appetizing. The labels
indicated the meals were not created with nutrition in mind. I am an
experienced researcher. I kicked into high gear and began reporting my
story. I read everything that was available. I ordered books. I read articles
online. I spoke to healthcare professionals. I shopped like a maniac. I could
not find a book of practical advice, so you hold in your hands the book I
wish I’d had when my mom was diagnosed.
Dysphagia impacts people of all age groups. It develops as a consequence
of numerous medical conditions, including neurological conditions related
to age, cancer treatment, accidents, and war injuries. It is widespread—
fifteen million Americans have a swallowing disorder—and lifethreatening. The condition affects a million new people a year, according to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Feeding is basic to life, and
a person has to eat or they will die. Additionally, if a person with
swallowing difficulties coughs and aspirates their food (that is, if food
enters the airway or lungs), they can get bacterial pneumonia, which is lifethreatening, difficult to cure, and requires hospitalization.
The diagnosis of dysphagia is an emotional time for both the patient and
their family. It involves not only a change in diet but also a change in how
food is prepared, stored, and served. You will need to rethink your kitchen
setup to include appliances like a food processor. I have given much
thought to how to make the process of transitioning to the requirements of
this type of cooking and meal-making easy.
From the moment you or your loved one receives a diagnosis of dysphagia,
you, your family, and any other caregivers have to rethink the home
healthcare situation, as feeding yourself or your loved one becomes all
about purees. While this might sound quite simple, it is not. I come from a
family of great cooks and have traveled all over the world looking for great
food and great stories. So when my mother received the diagnosis of
swallowing difficulties, I researched all the available cookbooks,
experimented with different brands of commercially available products, and
tried out a variety of kitchen tools. I also consulted with many healthcare
professionals in different medical fields and found resources for ordering
such useful products as thickened water and thickened ice cream. All of this
research took time, organization, and testing. Now I have gathered all of
this experience and information into this easy-to-use practical guide and
recipe book.
The recipes included are both nutritious and delicious. They make use of
fresh ingredients and foods like lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and whole
grains. I like to use organic foods when possible, whole foods (meaning
foods that have been processed as little as possible), and foods without
chemical additives and preservatives. I recommend using the best-quality
ingredients you can. Additionally, in putting together these recipes I used
the guidelines recommended by the International Dysphagia Diet
Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) and the Healthy Eating Plate of the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Many healthcare professionals have told me that nutrition for the elderly
and dysphagia patients is a completely overlooked area. The Covid-19
pandemic focused the nation’s attention on senior health because nutrition
plays a key role in boosting the immune system, and this in turn helps
prevent illness and reduce the need for hospitalization. I realized early on
that if my mother was to have a healthy diet, it was up to me. That is how
this guidebook came about, and I truly hope it will be of use to all people
affected—patients, healthcare professionals, caregivers, and family
members who are facing similar challenges.
But this book is more than a collection of recipes and food tips. It is meant
to offer a one-stop resource for dysphagia patients and their caregivers.
Theresa Richard, a speech-language pathologist, provides an excellent
overview of what dysphagia is and how it is diagnosed. She addresses
common myths and answers FAQs. Karen Sheffler, also a speech-language
pathologist (SLP), and an IDDSI expert, provides essential information
about the levels of IDDSI, the testing of food for compliance with IDDSI,
and a description of good practices for home healthcare.
Additionally, I take you step-by-step through my system for the setup and
organization of a dysphagia kitchen, with planning tips on how to cook on a
schedule, how many portions to cook at one time, ideas for batch cooking,
how to store food safely, and how to label the stored food so that a great
meal is always on hand. I cover the best cooking techniques for food that
will be pureed, and how to puree it for the perfect texture for ease of
swallowing. I talk about equipment to make pureeing easier, what to have
on hand in the freezer and the pantry, and more. These recipes may be
enjoyed by family and friends as well as by the patient and caregiver, as I
have been reminded by a noted SLP of the importance of social interaction,
a component of happiness, during meals. Isolation does not contribute to
quality of life.
Ina Garten, author of the Barefoot Contessa cookbooks, says that a cook
needs to master ten dishes. So, if you are the person with dysphagia, make a
list of your ten favorite dishes. If you are the caregiver, speak to the person
with the swallowing disorder to discover their ten dishes. Most have
variations. Once you have a list of favorites and variations, this means an
end to boredom.
And note that the meal is not only what’s on the plate, it’s also the
atmosphere, the smells and look of the food. Enjoy yourself. Involve the
person with the swallowing disorder. Pick flowers and make bouquets. Play
music. Have a dance in the kitchen.
Remember these mantras:
Food is medicine, food
is love.
Life is too short to eat
boring, tasteless food.
Even though the form
of the food changes,
food can still have the
delish factor.
It is better to have a
tweaked version of the
dish than not to have
the dish at all!

What Is a Swallowing Disorder?
Coping with Change
THERESA RICHARD, M.A., CCC-SLP, BCS-S,
Founder/CEO of the MedSLP Collective and MedSLP Education,
Host of the “Swallow Your Pride” podcast
Swallowing is a task that is completed several hundred times per day, even
up to seven hundred times per day, yet it’s not often thought of. A swallow
is a very complex and coordinated process that involves precise timing and
movement of various muscles and structures in the mouth, throat, and
esophagus. Its main function is to safely and efficiently transport food and
liquid from the mouth to the stomach for the purposes of nutrition and
quality of life.
A swallow can be broken down into three phases, but it’s important to note
that the process of swallowing should be considered a continuum, as each
phase can impact the others.
1. Mouth/oral phase. This phase is voluntary and involves chewing food
and mixing it with saliva to form a cohesive bolus (ball of food). The
tongue then propels the bolus toward the back of the mouth and into the
throat (pharynx).
2. Throat/pharyngeal phase. This phase is triggered without having to
think about it when the bolus reaches the back of the tongue and
touches the soft palate, the walls of the throat, and the area around the
tonsils. A complex sequence of events then occurs in rapid succession:
breathing temporarily stops, the muscles and cartilages of the vocal
cords close tightly to further protect the airway, and the muscles of the
pharynx contract in a wave-like motion (peristalsis) to squeeze the
bolus downward and into the esophagus.
3. Food tube/esophageal phase. This phase is also involuntary and begins
when the bolus enters the esophagus (a muscular tube connecting the
throat to the stomach). The esophageal muscles propel the bolus
downward toward the stomach.
This entire process occurs in a matter of seconds and requires precise
coordination of more than thirty pairs of muscles and multiple cranial
nerves that control these muscles. Any disruption in the timing, strength, or
coordination of these muscles can result in dysphagia. It’s important to note
that individuals’ anatomies can differ drastically, and although something
may seem “disordered” to a professional, it can still be considered
“functional” for a person if it is not bothersome to their quality of life.
A swallow is considered “safe” if food and liquid are transferred from the
mouth to the stomach without allowing any material to enter the airway or
lungs (aspiration). A completely safe swallow every time is not a realistic
expectation, as even healthy individuals occasionally aspirate small
amounts of food or liquid without any negative consequences. However,
frequent or significant aspiration can lead to serious complications such as
pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration.
Coughing during or after swallowing is a common sign that the body is
trying to protect the airway from aspiration. When sensory receptors in the
larynx (or voice box) detect foreign material, they trigger a cough reflex to
forcefully expel the material out of the airway. In this sense, a cough can be
seen as a positive indication that the body’s protective mechanisms are
functioning properly.
However, if coughing during or after swallowing occurs frequently, it may
be a sign of an underlying swallowing problem that needs further
evaluation. In addition to coughing, these signs and symptoms may include
choking during or after meals, a wet or gurgly voice during or after eating
or drinking, feeling like food or liquid is “going down the wrong pipe,” a
sensation of food getting stuck in the throat, pain during swallowing, or
recurrent pneumonia. If any of these symptoms are present, it is important
to seek an evaluation by a speech-language pathologist (SLP) who
specializes in swallowing disorders.
Sometimes the SLP may determine that your cough is simply your body
protecting itself. However, a cough can be downright annoying and
bothersome, and it can impact your quality of life if it happens frequently.
In this case, it is still important to speak to an SLP about possible cough
management solutions.
It is important to note that not all individuals with dysphagia will cough
when aspirating. In some cases, the sensory receptors in the larynx/voice
box may be impaired, leading to “silent aspiration,” in which material
enters the lungs without triggering a cough reflex. This is particularly
concerning because the aspiration can go undetected and lead to serious
complications over time. An instrumental swallowing evaluation can
identify silent aspiration and guide appropriate management strategies. If
your SLP concludes that your swallowing problems are potentially serious,
they will ask you to undergo a more formal evaluation and dysphagia
assessment.
Dysphagia Assessment
Dysphagia is usually assessed using a combination of clinical and
instrumental evaluations. The specific tests used will depend on your
symptoms, medical history, and overall health status.
The first step in assessing dysphagia is typically a clinical swallowing
evaluation (CSE), which is performed by an SLP. The CSE will include a
thorough review of your medical history, current symptoms, and
medications that may impact swallowing. An oral peripheral exam or
cranial nerve exam may be performed to assess the strength and
coordination of the muscles of the mouth, tongue, and cheeks, and to
evaluate the function of the nerves that control swallowing. An SLP may
also observe you swallowing different textures of food and liquid to assess
swallowing efficiency and determine which textures are safe for you. SLPs
may also administer swallowing-related quality-of-life questionnaires or
patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to gain insight on the impact
of the dysphagia from your perspective.
Based on the findings of the CSE, the SLP may recommend further
instrumental testing (using specialized technology and equipment) to assess
the safety and efficiency of the swallow and directly visualize the
swallowing process. A videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS), also
known as a modified barium swallow study (MBSS), involves having you
swallow various textures of food and liquid mixed with barium while a
series of X-ray images is taken (barium is a radiopaque contrast agent that
shows up on X-rays). The SLP and radiologist analyze the images to assess
the timing and coordination of swallowing, identify any structural
abnormalities, and determine if aspiration is occurring. The study provides a
comprehensive view of all phases of swallowing (oral, pharyngeal, and
esophageal) and can help guide treatment recommendations.
Another common instrumental test used to assess swallowing function is
the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). It involves a
thin, flexible endoscope being passed through the nose and into the throat to
directly visualize the pharynx and larynx during swallowing. FEES allows
for assessment of the throat phase of swallowing, including laryngeal
closure, muscle coordination, and presence of residue (food stuck in the
mouth, throat, and/or esophagus) or aspiration.
It is important to advocate for a thorough and comprehensive evaluation to
accurately diagnose and assess the nature and severity of dysphagia. If you
have concerns about the tests being recommended or the results of the
evaluation, don’t hesitate to ask questions and seek a second opinion if
needed. The results of these various tests are then used to diagnose the
specific type and severity of dysphagia and guide personalized treatment
recommendations (more on this in the next chapter). The SLP will work
closely with you, your family, and other members of your healthcare team
to develop a comprehensive management plan that addresses the physical,
nutritional, and psychosocial aspects of dysphagia. Regular follow-up
assessments are important to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan
as needed to ensure optimal outcomes.
The Emotional Impact of Dysphagia
The emotional impact of a dysphagia diagnosis can be profound. A
diagnosis of dysphagia can have far-reaching effects on your physical
health, emotional well-being, and social functioning. It can also
significantly impact the lives of caregivers and family members, who may
need to take on additional responsibilities and adapt to new routines.
Fear and anxiety around mealtimes due to the risk of choking or aspiration
are common. Difficulty participating in social activities that involve eating
and drinking, such as family meals, dining out, or attending parties and
events, can be challenging. Relationships may become strained if family
and friends do not understand the challenges and limitations imposed by
dysphagia. You may feel embarrassed or self-conscious about eating and
drinking in front of others, leading to social isolation and withdrawal.
Stigma and misunderstanding from others who may not be familiar with
dysphagia and its effects can further compound these social difficulties. The
loss of enjoyment and pleasure associated with eating and drinking, which
can be a significant source of quality of life for many individuals, can be
particularly difficult to cope with. Frustration, anger, or depression related
to the loss of independence and control over a basic life function may also
occur.
Caregivers may experience stress and burden as they take on additional
responsibilities and devote more time to meal planning, preparation,
assistance with feeding, and monitoring. The emotional stress and burden
related to managing a loved one’s nutrition, hydration, and safety needs can
be significant. Balancing caregiving responsibilities with work, family, and
personal obligations can be challenging. There is also a potential for
caregiver burnout and physical strain, particularly if the loved one requires
significant assistance with positioning and feeding.
If you are experiencing social and emotional difficulties with a diagnosis of
dysphagia, it is very important for you to discuss your feelings with your
SLP. The SLP can recommend psychologists or social workers who can
assist you with taking a holistic approach to dysphagia management that
addresses not only the physical aspects of swallowing but also the
emotional, social, and financial impacts on you and your family.
This approach may involve:
• Providing education and counseling to help you and your caregivers
understand the diagnosis and adapt to new routines and strategies for
managing dysphagia.
• Offering support groups or peer mentoring programs to connect you and
your caregivers with others who have similar experiences and
challenges.
• Assisting with navigating insurance coverage and identifying
community resources and support services to help alleviate financial
burdens.
By taking a comprehensive, person-centered approach to dysphagia
management, which prioritizes the individual’s comfort and safety,
healthcare professionals can help you and your family adapt to the
challenges of living with dysphagia and maintain the highest possible
quality of life.
Common Myths
There are several common myths and misconceptions about dysphagia that
can lead to misunderstandings about the condition and its management.
Here are some of the top myths and the facts to counter them:
MYTH 1
Thickened liquids are always safer for individuals with dysphagia.
FACT: While thickened liquids can be beneficial for some individuals with
dysphagia, they are not always the safest or most appropriate choice. The
decision to use thickened liquids should be based on a thorough swallowing
evaluation and the specific needs and goals of the individual.
In some cases, thickened liquids may actually increase the risk of aspiration
or other complications. Additionally, some individuals may find thickened
liquids unpalatable or may have difficulty meeting their hydration needs
with thickened liquids alone.
In other cases, individuals may prefer to continue using thickener. This
shared decision-making should be made with the SLP.
MYTH 2
The chin tuck technique should be used by everyone with dysphagia.
FACT: The chin tuck is a commonly used postural technique that involves
tucking the chin down toward the chest while swallowing. It can be helpful
for some individuals with dysphagia by protecting the airway and reducing
the risk of aspiration. The effectiveness of the chin tuck depends on the
specific nature and severity of the individual’s swallowing impairment. In
some cases, the chin tuck may actually make swallowing more difficult or
less efficient. Through an instrumental evaluation, the SLP will identify if
the chin tuck is likely to be effective for you.
MYTH 3
There is nothing that can be done to improve swallowing function in
individuals with dysphagia.
FACT: While dysphagia can be a challenging and persistent condition,
there are many strategies and interventions that can help improve
swallowing function and quality of life.
The specific approach will depend on the underlying cause and severity of
the dysphagia, as well as the individual’s goals and preferences. Some
common interventions include:
• Swallowing exercises and therapy techniques to strengthen the muscles
of the mouth and throat and improve coordination and timing of
swallowing.
• Postural adjustments to protect the airway and facilitate safe
swallowing.
• Diet modifications to alter the texture, consistency, or volume of foods
and liquids to make them easier and safer to swallow.
• Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to stimulate the muscles
of the throat and improve swallowing function.
• Biofeedback techniques to help individuals visualize and control their
swallowing movements.
• Surgical interventions to correct anatomical abnormalities or improve
swallowing function in specific cases.
MYTH 4
Feeding tubes are always a last resort and indicate a poor prognosis.
FACT: Feeding tubes can be a valuable tool for managing dysphagia and
ensuring adequate nutrition and hydration in some individuals. The decision
to use a feeding tube should be based on a careful assessment of the
individual’s nutritional status, swallowing abilities, overall health, and goals
of care.
In some cases, a feeding tube may be used as a temporary measure to
support nutrition and hydration while the individual participates in
1
swallowing therapy and works toward resuming oral eating. In other cases,
a feeding tube may be a long-term solution for individuals who are unable
to meet their nutritional needs safely or efficiently through oral intake
alone.
It is important to recognize that the use of a feeding tube does not
necessarily indicate a poor prognosis or quality of life. Many individuals
with feeding tubes are able to maintain active and fulfilling lives with
proper support and management. The key is to approach the decision to use
a feeding tube as part of a comprehensive, person-centered care plan that
prioritizes, as noted above, the individual’s comfort, safety, and quality of
life.
FAQs When Facing a Diagnosis
When facing a diagnosis of dysphagia, you and your family may have many
questions and concerns. Here are some of the most frequently asked
questions and some guidance on how to advocate for person-centered care.
What caused my dysphagia and is it treatable?
Dysphagia can result from a variety of conditions, including neurological
disorders, muscular disorders, structural abnormalities, and other medical
conditions. The specific cause of dysphagia will determine the most
appropriate treatment approach. Some causes of dysphagia may be
reversible with treatment, while others may require ongoing management to
minimize complications and maintain quality of life. It is important to work
with a healthcare team to identify the underlying cause of your dysphagia
and develop an individualized treatment plan.
2
3
Will I need to change my diet, and how will I meet my
nutritional needs?
If you have dysphagia, you may need to modify your diet to ensure safe and
efficient swallowing and to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. The
specific diet modifications recommended will depend on your swallowing
abilities and risks, as determined by the swallowing evaluation. Some
common diet modifications include:
• Altering the texture of foods to make them easier to chew and swallow
(e.g., pureeing, chopping, or softening foods).
• Thickening liquids to slow their flow and reduce the risk of aspiration.
• Limiting or avoiding foods that are difficult to chew or swallow (e.g.,
hard, crunchy, or stringy foods).
• Using special techniques or strategies to facilitate safe swallowing (e.g.,
chin tuck, multiple swallows, alternating bites of food with sips of
liquid).
It is important to work with an SLP and a registered dietitian to develop an
individualized meal plan that meets your nutritional needs while
minimizing the risk of complications. If you have concerns about the taste,
texture, or variety of the recommended diet, let your healthcare team know
so that they can help you find solutions that work for you.
What are the risks and complications of dysphagia?
Dysphagia can lead to a variety of complications if not properly managed,
including:
4
• Aspiration pneumonia. A lung infection that occurs when food, liquid,
or saliva enters the lungs.
• Malnutrition. Insufficient intake of nutrients due to difficulty
swallowing or avoidance of certain foods.
• Dehydration. Insufficient intake of fluids due to difficulty swallowing
or avoidance of liquids.
• Choking. A blockage of the airway by food or other objects.
• Social isolation. Avoidance of social situations involving eating or
drinking due to embarrassment or fear of choking.
It is important to work with your healthcare team to minimize the risks and
complications of dysphagia through proper evaluation, treatment, and
management.
If you experience any signs or symptoms of complications, such as
coughing or choking during meals, unexplained weight loss, or recurrent
respiratory infections, let your healthcare team know right away.
How can I continue to enjoy meals and social situations with
dysphagia?
Eating and drinking are important social and cultural activities that can be
challenging for individuals with dysphagia. However, there are many
strategies and adaptations that can help you continue to enjoy meals and
participate in social situations:
• Plan ahead. Call ahead to restaurants to inquire about their menu
options and their ability to accommodate special diets or requests.
5
• Bring your own food. If you are going to a social event where the food
options may be limited or unsuitable for your needs, consider bringing
your own food or snacks that you know you can eat safely.
• Use adaptive equipment. Special utensils, cups, and plates can make it
easier to eat and drink independently and safely.
• Take your time. Don’t feel rushed to finish your meal or keep up with
others. Take your time and focus on eating and drinking safely and
comfortably.
• Communicate your needs. Let your dining companions know about
your dysphagia and any special accommodations you may need. Most
people will be understanding and willing to help.
• Focus on the social aspect. Remember that meals are about more than
just the food. Enjoy the conversation, company, and atmosphere, even if
you are not able to eat or drink as much as you would like.
How can I advocate for myself and ensure I receive personcentered care?
Advocating for yourself and ensuring that you receive person-centered care
is essential for individuals with dysphagia. Here are some tips for being an
effective self-advocate:
• Educate yourself. Learn as much as you can about your dysphagia, its
causes, and its management. This will help you ask informed questions
and participate actively in your care.
• Communicate your needs and preferences. Let your healthcare team
know what is important to you, what you are willing and not willing to
do, and what you hope to achieve through treatment.
6
• Ask questions. If you don’t understand something or have concerns
about your care, speak up and ask for clarification or additional
information.
• Bring a support person. Consider bringing a trusted family member or
friend to your appointments to help you take notes, ask questions, and
advocate for your needs.
• Know your rights. Familiarize yourself with your rights as a patient,
including the right to informed consent, the right to refuse treatment,
and the right to a second opinion.
• Be persistent. If you feel that your needs are not being met or that your
concerns are not being addressed, don’t hesitate to speak up and
advocate for yourself.
• Seek support. Connect with other individuals and families affected by
dysphagia through support groups, online forums, or advocacy
organizations. These connections can provide valuable information,
support, and resources.
Remember, you are the expert on your own experiences, needs, and
preferences. Your healthcare team should work collaboratively with you to
develop a care plan that is tailored to your individual goals and priorities.
How can I ensure I receive appropriate care in a healthcare
facility?
If you have dysphagia and are in a healthcare facility, such as a hospital or
nursing home, it is important to advocate for appropriate care and
management. Here are some tips:
• Inform the staff. Make sure that all members of the healthcare team,
including doctors, nurses, and therapists, are aware of the dysphagia
diagnosis and any special needs or accommodations required.
• Provide documentation. Bring copies of any relevant medical records,
test results, or treatment plans to the facility and make sure they are
included in your chart.
• Request a swallowing evaluation. If a swallowing evaluation has not
been done recently or if there have been changes in your swallowing
function, request a new evaluation by an SLP.
• Review the care plan. Ask to see your care plan and make sure that it
includes appropriate interventions and accommodations for dysphagia,
such as diet modifications, feeding assistance, and oral care.
• Monitor for complications. Be vigilant for signs of complications, such
as coughing or choking during meals, weight loss, or signs of aspiration
pneumonia (fever, chills, night sweats), and report them to the
healthcare team immediately.
• Advocate for person-centered care. Remind the healthcare team of
your personal preferences, goals, and values, and make sure that the
care plan is aligned with these priorities.
• Escalate concerns. If you feel that your needs are not being met or that
their care is not appropriate, don’t hesitate to escalate your concerns to a
supervisor, patient advocate, or ombudsman.
Remember, healthcare facilities have a responsibility to provide safe,
appropriate, and person-centered care to all individuals, including those
with dysphagia. By advocating for yourself and working collaboratively
with the healthcare team, you can help ensure that you receive the care and
support you need.

Where can I find more information and support?
There are many resources available for individuals and families affected by
dysphagia. Some good places to start include the American SpeechLanguage-Hearing Association (ASHA), the National Foundation of
Swallowing Disorders (NFOSD), the Dysphagia Research Society (DRS),
and local hospitals, rehabilitation centers, or universities. There are also
many online communities and forums where individuals with dysphagia
and their caregivers can connect with others, share experiences and advice,
and find support. See the list of resources at the end of this book.
Remember, you are not alone on this journey. There is a wealth of
information, support, and resources available to help you navigate the
challenges of living with dysphagia.
What should I do if I suspect someone I know has dysphagia?
If you suspect that someone you know may have dysphagia, it is important
to encourage them to seek evaluation and treatment from a qualified
healthcare professional. Here are some steps you can take:
• Share your concerns. Talk to the person about what you have observed
and why you are concerned. Be gentle, nonjudgmental, and supportive.
• Encourage them to see a doctor. Suggest that they make an
appointment with their primary care physician to discuss their
symptoms and get a referral to an SLP or other specialist if needed.
• Offer to help. Offer to accompany them to their appointment, take
notes, or help them prepare questions to ask their doctor.
• Provide information. Share reliable information about dysphagia and
its management with the person and their family, but avoid giving
medical advice or making diagnoses.
• Be supportive. Let the person know that you are there to support them
and that there are resources and treatments available to help them
manage their dysphagia.
Dysphagia is a serious condition that can have significant impacts on a
person’s health, nutrition, and quality of life. Early identification and
intervention are key to preventing complications and maintaining optimal
function. By being proactive and supportive, you can help ensure that your
loved one gets the care and support they need.
Facing a diagnosis of dysphagia can be overwhelming and challenging for
you and your family.
However, by being informed, proactive, and advocating for person-centered
care, you can work with your healthcare team to develop an individualized
management plan that addresses your unique needs, preferences, and goals.
Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to dysphagia management,
and what works for one person may not work for another. The key is to stay
informed, communicate openly with your healthcare team, and advocate for
the care and support you need to maintain your health, safety, and quality of
life.

You Have Dysphagia
What’s Next?
KAREN SHEFFLER, M.S., CCC-SLP, BCS-S
Founder/Editor of SwallowStudy.com and SwallowStudy &
Associates, LLC
You have been given the diagnosis of dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).
What does that mean for you? This may mean a transition to a new form of
eating. Hopefully, you have medical guidance, and now you will need
practical advice for the home healthcare environment. The principles in this
book for the dysphagia kitchen may be applied in a healthcare facility. The
content in this chapter will also help you advocate for yourself or your
loved one.
Your primary care physician has created a healthcare team to gather more
information about you and your dysphagia in order to devise a treatment
plan for you. As part of this information gathering, a speech-language
pathologist (SLP) will assess your swallowing capability.
Instrumental evaluations, as discussed in the prior chapter, are two types of
swallowing tests by an SLP that use specialized technology and equipment.
One is the videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS), also known as a
modified barium swallow study (MBSS), and is an X-ray that is like a video
or movie of your swallow. The other test, a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation
of swallowing (FEES), uses a thin endoscope inserted through the nose and
into the throat to see the swallow.
Based on the problems found in testing by your SLP, and/or
recommendations from your medical team, you may be referred to other
specialists. For example, difficulty swallowing often happens across more
than one phase of the swallowing process. You may have problems in
multiple phases at the same time. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is when
swallowing problems happen in both the mouth and throat phases.
Pharyngoesophageal dysphagia is when there are problems in the
throat/pharynx and esophagus. Problems in different phases may require
input from different specialists.
The following are some of the specialists who work closely with SLPs:
• An ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor, also called an otolaryngologist,
can make sure that your voice box (larynx), which houses your vocal
cords, is working well for airway protection and swallowing safely. The
ENT also addresses issues with the upper esophageal sphincter, which
allows material into the top of the esophagus.
• A gastroenterologist (GI) is a doctor who specializes in the entire
digestive system and manages swallowing and eating issues of the
esophagus and stomach.
• A neurologist evaluates and treats issues of the nervous system that may
cause problems in sensation or motor movements related to eating and
swallowing. A neurologist also collaborates with an SLP to evaluate
thinking skills (cognition), memory, problem-solving, and attention,
which can greatly impact the safety of your swallow.
• A psychiatrist addresses issues of medications for mental health that
may cause difficulty swallowing, and treats any anxiety, depression, fear
of swallowing, or food aversion issues that may impact your eating.
• A pharmacist may check to see if any of your medications are causing
trouble swallowing, are causing dry mouth, or are making your reflux
worse, for example.
• A registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) helps you make sure you are
getting enough nutrition and hydration (eating and drinking enough).
They make recommendations about tube feedings if you are not getting
all your nutrition by mouth or give you options for oral supplements.
After the examinations, make sure you understand all the findings. Did your
care team explain clearly what happened and what you can do about it?
What procedures and/or surgeries may help? Ask more questions if needed.
It often helps to watch videos of your swallowing evaluation and review
anatomy pictures with the specialists.
What Happened in the Swallowing Evaluations?
The swallowing evaluation tells you more than whether you aspirated (i.e.,
food, liquid, or pills went into your airway or lungs) or not. It is a motion
picture of what is happening when you swallow.
What worked and did not work? What part of your eating/swallowing has
problems? How can those problems be addressed? What are the risks to
your health and quality of life?
SLPs consider swallowing problems from two different perspectives: safety
and efficiency.
Safety (Severity of Aspiration Risk)
If you aspirate, you may respond by coughing or clearing your throat.
However, sometimes things go down the wrong way and you do not feel it
or show any obvious signs at all. That is called silent aspiration, which can
be very concerning for you or for your caregiver at home. Silent aspiration
is common in people who have reduced sensation due to dementia,
Parkinson’s disease, or radiation after head and neck cancer, for example.
This further highlights the need for instrumental evaluations of swallowing.
MORE ABOUT ASPIRATION
Aspiration can sometimes lead to a lung infection called pneumonia. However, it is
not a simple path from aspiration to pneumonia. Not all people who have aspiration
will get sick with pneumonia. A bacterial lung infection, called aspiration
pneumonia, usually happens more often in someone who has poor mouth hygiene,
with a lot of bacteria buildup in the mouth and around the teeth.
Other risk factors that make pneumonia more common include: dependence on
another person for feeding, being bedridden, frequent aspiration in large amounts,
reduced immune system response, and smoking. Discuss your own risk factors
with your team.
See the end of this chapter for more about oral hygiene and prevention of
aspiration pneumonia.
Efficiency (Amount of Residue and Choking Risk)
The evaluation may also find that food, liquids, or pills are getting stuck in
the mouth, throat, and/or esophagus. That is called residue. Residue could
go down the wrong way after you eat. Also, if too much residue builds up in
your throat, you could be at risk for choking.1
Dysphagia Treatment
What Can You Do About Your Dysphagia?
Once all the information is gathered from your thorough dysphagia
evaluation, your healthcare team can develop a treatment plan.
Your SLP will teach you ways to reduce your risks of aspiration and
residue. The SLP clinician will talk with you about your goals and
preferences, share recommendations, and discuss options that you could try,
such as the following:
1. See other specialists. The SLP will often suggest that you talk to other
members of your healthcare team to see what they recommend.
Sometimes these healthcare providers can suggest certain procedures,
surgeries, medications, or other methods to help you swallow better and
maintain good nutrition and hydration. It is important to follow up on
those suggestions.
› Registered dietitian nutritionists can make sure that you are taking
in enough calories and liquids.
› Physical therapists can help improve posture, body and neck
strength, and positioning. They can give exercises to strengthen the
body overall.
› Occupational therapists can give ideas on how to feed yourself
easily and with less effort, so that you can avoid getting tired
quickly.
› Ear, nose, and throat doctors may suggest procedures to improve
your vocal cord closure (to protect your airway better) or to loosen
a tight upper esophageal sphincter. They can test for and treat
reflux, especially when the reflux is getting up high into your throat
and may be giving you the sense that you have a lump in your
throat.
› Gastroenterologists can look directly at the esophagus to see if there
is a narrowing that can be stretched. They can also test the muscles
of the esophagus (a test called esophageal manometry) to see if they
are squeezing in a good and coordinated way to clear the food into
the stomach.
2. Rehabilitation. An SLP who specializes in swallowing can customize a
set of exercises. These may vary greatly from person to person, as the
SLP can develop specific plans to improve the timing, coordination,
and strength of all the muscles involved in chewing and swallowing.
Exercises must be targeted to the specific problems you are having with
your swallow. In other words, if the problem is that the back of the
tongue is not adequately pushing the food down, then the exercises may
be intended to improve the effort of that push; however, if your
problem is in the esophagus, tongue exercises may do you no good.
Some exercises have the goal of improving your ability to cough and
clear material that may go down the wrong way. You must have a full
evaluation, including instrumental evaluations, to target therapy to your
needs. Specific exercise details are beyond the scope of this book.
3. Strategies to compensate for dysphagia. Compensatory strategies
change how you eat and drink in order to make it easier and potentially
safer to swallow. Examples include:
› Safer2
 swallowing strategies.
› Mealtime and environment changes.
› Head or body positioning to make it easier to swallow.
› Food and liquid texture changes (i.e., diet modifications).
4. Infection control and prevention of aspiration pneumonia. Some
examples include:
› Keeping your mouth and teeth very clean to reduce your risk of
aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration cannot be prevented 100 percent
of the time, despite all the safer swallowing strategies used.
However, the goal is twofold: to reduce aspiration and to reduce the
risk of getting sick with aspiration pneumonia. Good oral hygiene
helps with the second goal.
› Staying active and exercising to help the lungs become stronger and
better able to clear out small amounts of aspiration.
The specific set of recommendations that you will be given is your
treatment plan. Your treatment plan will be crafted with you to address your
own goals, preferences, and wishes. Your healthcare providers may offer
you referrals and rehabilitation methods to improve your swallow, but this
book will not go into detail on those items.
Dysphagia Management at Home and in
Healthcare Facilities
All of the following information applies whether you are at home or
advocating for your care at any healthcare facility.
Simple Solutions
This book aims to give you simple solutions for your home. These focus on
strategies to compensate for dysphagia and reduce risks of choking and
aspiration. While this book cannot recommend all the specifics of what is
best for you, we can introduce the ideas of safer swallowing strategies and
infection prevention.
If you understand the ideas and options better, you will be better able to
review them with your specialists so that you can be active in crafting your
treatment plan. This is person-centered care.
Before we get to some specific safer swallowing strategies, we need to
cover person-centered care and your decision-making around your own
eating and swallowing.
Person-Centered Care and Decision-Making
With all the information provided to you by your medical team, you are
considering the options and what may be right for you. You are the center of
your medical team. You are the driver of the team.
Person-centered care is certainly not the doctors telling you what they think
is best for you. However, medical decision-making can be quite complex,
and you may need help. The best decisions for you are based not only on all
the facts and data but also on your goals, preferences, lifestyle, and wishes
for yourself. Healthcare providers should see you not as a patient but as a
whole person, who may come with a support circle that includes family
members, friends, and other caregivers. When a person is no longer able to
make their own decisions, they will have an appointed healthcare proxy to
carry out their previously stated wishes.
Before this chapter dives into ways to change the texture and thickness
(viscosity) of foods and liquids, it’s important to say again that every person
should discuss all options with their medical team. Ask yourself these
questions:
• What is right for me and the goals I have for myself?
• Do I understand what is wrong at each phase of my swallow—mouth
(oral), throat (pharyngeal), and tube to stomach (esophageal)?
• Do I need to learn more about what has worked and what has not
worked?
• Do I need any more testing?
• Do I understand all my options and the risks and benefits (or pluses and
minuses) for me?
• What other questions do I still have?
Treatment Plan for Safer Swallowing
Now that you and your care providers have the information you need, we
will cover how to compensate for the dysphagia (including information
about standardized diets for dysphagia), environmental changes you can
make, tips for holidays and travel, and prevention of further issues. Part II
of this book details changes you may want to make to your kitchen and
food preparation, and Part III provides more than one hundred recipes.
Compensatory Strategies to Manage Dysphagia
The idea of compensation means that, instead of making the problem go
away, you are working around it with some strategies. Swallowing
strategies may have you eat and drink a little differently to make doing so
easier and potentially safer. Of course, many people do not want to change
what they are eating; everyone has their own preferences and habits.
Therefore, these are options for you to consider when making decisions
about your treatment plan.
Safer Swallowing Strategies
Right after the evaluation, the SLP may provide you with customized
options to make eating and swallowing easier, such as by:
• Making sure you are eating in a good upright posture with any
positioning supports that you may need. Typically, sitting up at a 90-
degree angle is recommended, but sometimes your instrumental
evaluation will suggest other positions (e.g., side-lying) to use as you
eat and swallow.
• Changing how you eat and drink. These may include the following head
positions (warning: do not try any of these before you have an
instrumental evaluation by your SLP clinician, as some positions could
make the problem much worse):
› Chin tuck
› Head turn
› Head turn and tuck down to the shoulder
› Head tilt
› Side-lying position or reclined position
Your SLP may also recommend any of the following safer swallowing
strategies:
› Slow down the rate of eating or drinking.
› Try to chew up your food better.
› Avoid distractions and talking with food in your mouth or before
swallowing.
› Take smaller bites or sips (but sometimes taking larger bites/sips is
found to be the best approach; ask your SLP).
› Take a sip of liquid after every few bites of food to help wash food
residue through your throat and through the tube (esophagus) to your
stomach.
› Use an effortful swallow, pushing harder with your tongue and
squeezing with your throat muscles.
› Before attempting a swallow, bear down and hold your breath (this
closes the vocal cords tightly), then sip and swallow, and finally release
the breath with a cough and dry swallow. This method protects the top
of the airway before you take the sip. The cough ejects any drops of
liquid that may have entered into the top of the airway during the
swallow. This is called the super supraglottic swallow strategy (we
share that mouthful of a name so that you can really impress your SLP).
› Have small but more frequent meals and snacks (for example, six small
meals a day instead of three larger meals).
• Changing how you take your pills, as the process of swallowing whole
pills with thin liquid is one of the riskiest swallowing tasks. Try taking
them one at a time with a sip of water. If that is too challenging,
swallow pills in a pill-swallow gel (such as Gloup, formerly known as
Phazix; see Resources). Talk with your pharmacist about food-drug
interactions if you have been embedding pills in applesauce or dairybased purees. Do not crush your pills unless you have cleared that with
your pharmacist. You cannot put crushed pills in a thickened liquid or
add thickener to any liquid medication.
• Making sure you are feeding yourself as much as possible, with
assistance and cueing as needed. People who are completely dependent
on another person for feeding can have a higher risk of aspiration and
aspiration pneumonia. Your SLP and occupational therapist may provide
you with further guidance on feeding.
It is important to note again that many of these strategies need to be trialed
first with instrumental evaluations (using X-ray or endoscope) to see if they
actually work. Both of these types of examinations can trial liquids, solids,
and pills while you are doing specific postures, head maneuvers, and other
strategies. Some strategies, such as the chin tuck (taking a sip of liquid,
holding it in the mouth, tucking the chin, and then swallowing with the chin
tucked), can actually make the swallow worse for some people, causing the
liquid to go down the wrong way.
Diet Texture Modification (Diet Framework of IDDSI
[International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative])
Changing the texture of your diet may be an effective compensatory
strategy for dysphagia. These techniques include:
• Making sure that foods are soft and easy to chew.
• Reducing the size of food pieces, such as cutting food up into bite-sized
pieces that are about the size of your thumbnail, mincing, or
blending/pureeing foods).
• Adding sauce or other moisture to foods to make food more slippery.
• Thickening liquids.
• Cooking food with techniques that render it moist and tender, ideal for
puree (much more on that in Part II of this book).
One excellent resource is the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation
Initiative (iddsi.org), the globally agreed-upon standardized framework for
all solids and liquids (ranging from regular foods and regular liquids
through dysphagia diets and thickened liquids), as well as detailed
definitions and testing methods.
Please see the IDDSI Framework and IDDSI tutorial at the end of this
chapter, starting here.
Environmental Strategies to Manage Dysphagia
Now that we have talked about how and what you are eating and drinking,
let’s think about the environment around you. Where you are eating is
important for the success of your meals.
For many people challenged by dysphagia, swallowing difficulties are
accompanied by other difficulties that can impact your mealtime or social
eating setting: hearing loss, impaired vision, difficulty attending in the
presence of background noise, reduced memory, and reduced problemsolving ability or safety awareness.
Some of these may be especially the case for people with head injuries,
stroke, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease. The following tips can be applied
at home or in any eating situation.
Reduce Distractions and Supervise as Needed
• Make sure to turn off the TV or lower the volume on background music.
• Monitor the loudness, distractions, and conversations at mealtime or
around the family dinner table. Find out what level is too much, causing
difficulty in attention and concentration. You may need to make changes
so that mealtime is quiet and free of distractions.
• Reduce the amount of food and drink items that are in front of you if
you have difficulty with distractions. One plate, one utensil, and one cup
may be enough.
• Small meals and/or small portions may be best, especially when at a
large social event.
• Think about seating arrangements around the table, placing one or two
people next to you who could provide subtle help and cues as needed.
• Request supervision as needed to keep you on task and doing your safer
swallowing strategies (such as not eating too fast).
Lighting and Visuals
• Make sure to have good lighting in your dining area.
• Use plates that provide a good visual contrast between the plate and the
food (e.g., solid white plate with darker-colored food).
Humidification
• Add humidifiers if dry mouth is a major issue at mealtime.
• Make sure your mouth is clean and moist prior to eating. If you have dry
mouth, bring your artificial saliva substitute spray bottle. Spray, swish,
and swallow before your meal to lubricate your swallowing pipes, and
to better enjoy your meal.
Tips for Holidays and Travel
Managing dysphagia at home can be difficult and time-consuming at any
time, but around the holidays it can be even tougher. You may be traveling
away from home, joining large gatherings where food options may be
limited, or spending time with family or friends who may not be as familiar
with your eating/swallowing needs. In addition to the environmental
considerations above, here are some more tips.
Enjoy Many Holiday Foods That Are Already Pureed
• Many foods commonly found at the table on North American holidays,
like mashed squash, mashed potatoes, and smooth cranberry sauce, are
already pureed.
• Pumpkin pie is mostly a pureed food. Rather than using a typical flour
crust, search for a recipe with a graham cracker crust. Pulverized
graham crackers are held together with loads of butter, making the
whole pie smooth and moist.
Add Moisture to Make Foods Slippery
• Traveling can make dry mouth worse, as you are out of your routine and
airplane travel will certainly exacerbate the problem.
• Holiday meals may be particularly difficult in colder environments with
heat on, as that dries out the room.
• Adding gravies and sauces to purees and other soft foods gives a
delicious flavor punch while making them moist and slippery for easier
swallowing.
• As foods cool down, they will tend to become stickier. Watch out for
mashed potatoes, as they can be quite thick and sticky. Add butter,
gravy, and sour cream. Heat up foods as needed.
• A heart-healthier option is olive oil. You can find many delicious
flavored olive oils (such as basil, rosemary, thyme, or other herbs and
spices) that complement food beautifully. Many people with dysphagia
find that olive oil really does the trick to make foods more slippery and
prevent them from getting stuck. Travel with a small sealable bottle.
Thickened Liquids on the Go
• Bring thickener packets (made by thickener companies) or your
thickener in a sealable container. Don’t forget your IDDSI Funnel or 10
mL syringe for the IDDSI Flow Test.
› Bring your own teaspoon or tablespoon measuring device so that
you can add your thickener without having to ask your host. Being
prepared ahead of time helps you be discreet and focus on the fun of
the holidays rather than all the technical issues.
• Bring your own thickened liquids in resealable bottles (follow thickener
instructions, as each product is different and each liquid thickens
differently).
› Resealable bottles will allow you to prepare your liquids ahead of
time or add thickener packets to any liquid just before serving. Just
shake before serving to make sure the thickener powder or gel is
still mixed in well. Then pour your beverage into a nice glass on the
table. That makes it easy for your hosts to meet your thickened
liquid needs.
• Check all soups and special drinks to make sure they are the appropriate
thickness.
› Eggnog will likely pass an IDDSI Flow Test as a Mildly Thick liquid
(Level 2), but double-check with your 10 mL syringe or IDDSI
Funnel.
› If your host is serving a soup that has solids in a clear, thin broth,
that is a mixed consistency, which may be harder to manage. Soups
can be easily blended to a smooth and thick consistency by using a
portable blender. There are small blenders that are easy to travel
with (e.g., Magic Bullet). Potatoes will naturally thicken a soup
when blended, or you may have to add a little thickening agent to
your final product to meet your prescribed thickened liquid level.
Infection Control and Aspiration Pneumonia
Prevention
As discussed above, we cannot prevent aspiration 100 percent of the time.
Food, liquids, pills, saliva, or even refluxed stomach contents sometimes go
down the wrong way. Aspiration can cause a lung infection, called
aspiration pneumonia. Not all people who aspirate will get aspiration
pneumonia; therefore, let’s consider what puts someoneat a higher risk for
getting sick with an aspiration pneumonia. Then maybe you can find ways
to lower your own risk.
Risk Factors for Aspiration Pneumonia
As noted earlier in this chapter (in More About Aspiration), there is no
simple path from aspiration to pneumonia. The development of aspiration
pneumonia is more complex. The following outline makes this complex
sequence easier to understand. Each step listed below has predictors or
factors that increase a person’s risk to develop an aspiration pneumonia
infection. These predictors of aspiration pneumonia are based on
foundational studies by Dr. Susan Langmore and colleagues in 1998 and
2002 (see Sources).
1. High levels of potentially harmful bacteria in the mouth (pathogenic
microorganisms). Many bacteria colonize the mouth, throat, and
stomach. Often when someone is ill and in a healthcare institution, the
bacterial environment changes from good bacteria to bad bacteria. The
following factors can increase the levels of harmful bacteria that can
enter the lungs during aspiration and make a person sick:
› Dependency on others to keep the mouth, teeth, gums, tongue, and
palate clean.
› Large number of decayed teeth and poor gums.
› Taking a lot of medications (more than five is called polypharmacy).
Many types of medications cause dry mouth (hyposalivation or
xerostomia), which can cause poor oral and dental health.
› Taking medications that reduce the acid in the stomach. This
changes the stomach pH, causing it to become more alkaline, which
can foster harmful bacterial growth.
› Tube feeding: The tube feeding formulas can also make the stomach
alkaline. People who are tube-fed may not eat anything by mouth
(also known as NPO, which is the Latin abbreviation of nil per os).
Therefore, they are missing the mechanical action of chewing and
stripping the food bolus through the mouth and throat that helps to
keep these areas clean. The mouth of a person who is NPO tends to
have less healthy salivary flow, and the mouth can become coated
with a sticky film of bad (pathogenic) bacteria.
2. Aspiration. Aspiration, as we have discussed, is when food, liquid,
saliva, and/or stomach contents go down the wrong way and into the
lungs. The following factors will increase the likelihood that aspiration
will occur in significant amounts:
› Being bedridden. Eating in bed in a poor position increases
aspiration risk. Being bedridden also increases the risk of refluxing
(bringing up) stomach contents and aspirating them.
› Tube feeding. In the case of a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube
(feeding tubes in the nose or directly into the abdomen), the liquid
formula is pumped into the stomach. This may increase your risk of
aspirating tube feedings if you have poor positioning, reflux, and
reduced airway protection. It is important to discuss formulas, rate,
tube feeding scheduling, and positioning needs with your medical
team.
› Delirium or a confused and less alert mental status.
› Dependency on others to be fed, as the rate of feeding may be too
much and too fast.
› Dysphagia with recommendations for a dysphagia diet or
mechanically altered diet (which may indicate that the swallowing
problem is more severe).
3. Poor pulmonary clearance. When the lungs have difficulty raising up
and expectorating aspirated material and secretions, this is called
decreased pulmonary clearance. The following predictors make it more
likely that this aspirated material mixed with bad bacteria will then stay
in the lungs:
› Requires suctioning to clear secretions.
› Smoking, which harms the lungs’ ability to clear out material and
prevent infection.
› Diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
congestive heart failure (CHF), and other respiratory problems.
› Being bedridden. The lungs will have a harder time clearing out
aspirated material when a person is in bed and not able to move on
their own.
4. Poor immune system response to resist an infection. The following
predictors contribute to a decreased ability to fight off infection (also
called decreased host resistance, reduced systemic immunologic
response, and immunosuppression):
› Weight loss, generalized weakness, and frailty.
› Multiple medical diagnoses.
Final Take-Home Prevention Tips
You may not be able to immediately improve all your eating and
swallowing challenges. However, you are taking a big step forward. You are
reading Cooking for Dysphagia to reduce the effort that you have with
eating/swallowing, while still enjoying your favorite foods and drinks. That
can reduce choking risks, aspiration risks, weight loss, and
dehydration/malnutrition risks, while hopefully improving your quality of
life.
Finally, here are three key tips that can make a big difference:
1. Stay active and out of bed as much as possible.
› Stay active to help the lungs become stronger and better able to
clear out small amounts of aspiration. (Activity is based on
recommendations by your medical team, of course.)
› A physical therapist and occupational therapist can provide a safe
treatment plan for how to stay active, with exercises for the body
and lungs.
› When you strengthen the body overall you can prevent muscle loss
and frailty.
2. Improve your cough.
› Coughing clears material out of your airway and out of your lungs.
That cough is your secondary line of defense against aspiration
pneumonia. You may have some aspiration, but if your lungs are
healthy and you have a strong cough, your overall risks are lower.
› Ask your medical team about ways to evaluate and improve your
cough (e.g., pulmonology testing or otolaryngology [ENT] testing
to assess whether any vocal cord impairments are weakening the
cough).
› The speech-language pathologist, occupational therapist, and
physical therapist can provide cough assist tools or cough
strengthening devices to improve your cough.
3. Keep your mouth very clean. This helps reduce buildup of the bad
(pathogenic) bacteria that can make you sick with aspiration
pneumonia.
› This is sometimes called oral care, but it needs to be more important
than a task like combing hair. Good oral hygiene practices should
really be called “oral infection control,” as keeping the mouth clean
can help prevent you from getting sick (i.e., aspiration pneumonia
prevention).
› See a dentist every six months or more frequently based on your
needs.
› Brush your teeth, floss, use a water flosser, and rinse with
mouthwash. Get an evaluation by your dentist and ask for training
in using these tools. Schedule your next checkup today.
› Brush your teeth first thing in the morning, after you eat, and before
you go to bed at night. Make sure there is no food pocketed in your
cheeks or stuck around your mouth.
› If you wear dentures or partial plates, it is important to remove them
after meals to brush away food that is stuck around them. Soak
them at night according to your dentist's instructions.
› Mouthwash. Avoid mouth rinses with alcohol. If you have good
control in your mouth, you can rinse with a mouthwash that is a thin
liquid. Hang your head over the sink, swish, and spit out. Do not
swallow the mouthwash. If you have difficulty keeping the liquid
controlled in your mouth, dip your mouth sponge or toothbrush in
the mouthwash and sweep it around your mouth and scrub your
tongue. Spit out all excess. Have a home suction machine available
as needed. There are products that you can purchase for safer
brushing and rinsing actions, including suction toothbrushes and
suction swabs. Do not add thickener to mouthwash.
› After thorough mouth cleaning, use an oral moisturizer that protects
your teeth and gums. There are several artificial saliva substitutes
on the market (similar to artificial tears for dry eye). You can get
these in a gel, mouth spray, or oral-adhering wafer. The mouth
spray bottles are so convenient to carry with you throughout the day
and when traveling. Keep one at the bedside for overnight dryness
that may disturb your sleep. You can spray, swish, and swallow
these products.
› Also, clean your mouth before you eat, especially if you have dry
mouth, which increases the risk for bad bacteria buildup. Brushing
will stimulate saliva flow. Use the oral moisturizer to “lubricate
your pipes” before eating.
In “The 3 Pillars of Aspiration Pneumonia” by John R. Ashford, Ph.D., CCC-SLP
(www.sasspllc.com/three-pillars-of-pneumonia), Dr. Ashford identifies three factors
that lead to someone getting sick with aspiration pneumonia:
1. Aspiration (saliva, liquids, and/or food particles going down the wrong way,
into the lungs).
2. Bad bacteria in the mouth.
3. Weakened immune response and frailty.
This information has been provided to supplement and support the
information you have received from your full medical team. All this
dysphagia content can be helpful as you navigate your healthcare, from the
hospital through the rehabilitation and skilled nursing settings. It may also
help your caregivers and loved ones become strong advocates for you.
Then, hopefully, the rest of this book will provide a bridge from healthcare
to home, as you create your dysphagia kitchen and return to enjoying your
favorite foods and drinks.

IDDSI
The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative
The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) was formed in 2013 as a
volunteer-run initiative with scientists, researchers, and clinicians from around the world
collaborating to create a new globally standardized diet framework and testing methods,
because standardization fosters patient safety. See iddsi.org for the latest version of the
IDDSI Framework, detailed definitions of each of the IDDSI levels, and the IDDSI testing
methods. Please refer to the IDDSI website for all its resources, including patient/caregiver
handouts. This chapter is meant to be an educational summary only.
IDDSI Framework
The world has agreed on how to categorize, label, describe, and test all foods and liquids
with regard to eating, chewing, and swallowing. All foods and liquids have been assigned to
a level based on standardized testing procedures, and the levels are easily identifiable by
name, color, and number, as in the diagram here.
The IDDSI standards mean that healthcare providers and consumers can finally speak the
same language. A standardized system makes it possible for people around the world to
order, prepare, and serve similar textures of food and consistency of liquids for people with
dysphagia.
In the image, you can see that the categorization of foods ranges from Regular solids (Level
7) through the “dysphagia diets” of Easy to Chew (Level 7), Soft & Bite-Sized (Level 6),
Minced & Moist (Level 5), Pureed (Level 4), and Liquidised (Level 3). The drinks move up
from thin liquids like water (Level 0) to thicker and thicker liquids, all the way up to Level 4
(Extremely Thick), which would have to be consumed using a spoon. The category of
transitional foods includes foods that change from one texture to another (such as
popsicles) or dissolve in the mouth (such as teething wafers).
IDDSI Testing Methods
The IDDSI testing methods are used to make sure a specific food is right for you. The focus
is on testing individual foods and liquids, rather than giving you a list of what to eat and what
not to eat. You can use IDDSI testing methods to test any food across any culture. For
example, imagine how a ripe banana is much softer than one that is still green; therefore,
we cannot simply say that all bananas are “soft.” IDDSI likes to remind users: “When in
doubt, test it out.”
IDDSI provides simple food-testing methods that can be done in any kitchen with common
tools: fingers, spoons, forks, and/or chopsticks. In this chapter we focus on testing methods
that utilize forks and spoons; however, information about adapting testing methods for use
with chopsticks and fingers can be found on iddsi.org and IDDSI’s YouTube channel
(youtube.com/@iddsi2903).
Testing helps us avoid vague terms such as “bite-sized,” “cut-up,” “soft,” “easy to chew,” and
“smooth and moist” that could be interpreted in different ways by different people.
These concepts are defined with the IDDSI testing methods (summarized here). For
example, we know that if we use testing methods for Soft & Bite-Sized, Level 6 (such as the
Fork Pressure Test for “soft” and particle-size measurements for bite-sized), we can
significantly reduce choking risks. A piece of soft food that is cut into a cube roughly the size
of an adult’s thumbnail (1.5 cm on each side) is smaller than your airway. Therefore, that
bite of food will most likely fall through your adult airway without blocking the airway and
making it difficult or even impossible to breathe. That will reduce the risk of death from
choking. See iddsi.org for pediatric bite-size requirements.
IDDSI Progress
IDDSI has already been implemented in many places across the United States, as multiple
professional organizations supported the IDDSI implementation and rollout in May 2019.
Some countries have benefited from faster IDDSI adoption due to smaller size and
governmental mandates.
When all healthcare facilities adopt this standardized framework, there will be less
confusion when a person goes from the hospital to a rehabilitation facility to home. The
hospital should provide a diet order at discharge that uses the same naming system as the
skilled nursing facility or the visiting nurse association that is admitting the person. That
allows for clear and standardized communications and trainings.
However, facilities in your area may be at different stages in the implementation of IDDSI.
While you can certainly advocate for IDDSI implementation in your local healthcare
facilities, you can also learn and use IDDSI standards for food and drink preparation at
home. All the recipes in Part III of this book use the IDDSI standards. IDDSI aims to improve
patient safety everywhere.
IDDSI and Person-Centered Care
IDDSI does not tell you what you are “allowed to eat” or “not allowed to eat.” Rather, IDDSI
will promote better person-centered care, as it provides a set of standardized labels and
descriptions to allow for clear communication among healthcare providers and the people
they serve. Good communication helps people understand their options and make better
healthcare decisions.
The IDDSI Framework
Providing a common terminology for describing food textures and drink thicknesses to
improve safety for individuals with swallowing difficulties
This diet framework is for all ages and all settings. The IDDSI Framework is being
translated into many different languages.

information.

Using IDDSI Testing Methods in Your Kitchen
Make sure you understand the IDDSI testing methods listed in the chart. This section will
cover four key tests, but for all IDDSI testing methods, please see:
www.iddsi.org/standards/testing -methods. You will be using these in your kitchen as you
prepare and serve foods. The first two tests listed below are great for solids. The last two
tests are for all kinds of liquids, soups, and sauces.
IDDSI Fork Pressure Test
This is a favorite test. It is so clear and useful because it defines “soft” food. Here are the
steps:
1. Use a standard dinner fork (metal is better than plastic). If no fork is available, you can
use a spoon, chopstick, or finger.
2. Put a piece of food on the plate. (When testing for Level 6, Soft & Bite-Sized, use a
piece no bigger than 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm.)
3. Hold the fork with your thumb pressing into the bowl of the fork (just above the tines and
below the handle).
4. Use the amount of pressure needed to make your thumbnail lighten. (That is the
amount of pressure we use with our tongue to push food down with the swallow.)
RESULT: The food should squash or mash and not return to its original shape. You may see
fork marks in the food. That means that the food is “soft” and passes the Fork Pressure
Test. It should not stick to the fork.
PRO TIPS | Fork Pressure Test
• This test measures softness. But you can really reduce choking risks in adults by
also cutting food into bite-sized pieces no bigger than 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm (roughly
the size of an average adult thumbnail).
• If you are using this test for Level 4 (Pureed) or Level 5 (Minced & Moist), your
thumbnail should not lighten. The food is softer and should be able to be mashed
without much pressure.
IDDSI Spoon Tilt Test
This is an important test for making sure your pureed food is smooth and moist. Imagine a
sticky mashed potato, especially when it gets cold. You could throw it at the wall, and it will
stick! You don’t want pureed foods to stick to the tongue, the roof of the mouth, or the throat.
This simple test with a spoon (or fingers) will help. This test is also used for Level 4
(Extremely Thick liquid) and Level 5 (Minced & Moist). Here are the steps:
1. Scoop up a full spoonful on a spoon.
2. Check to see if the food holds its shape on the spoon. We call that moist and cohesive,
meaning that the food holds together in a mound. You do not want a sticky, dry, or
crumbly texture.
3. Tilt or turn the spoon sideways. You may use a gentle flick of the wrist.
RESULT: Food slides or plops off the spoon. Only a thin film or coating of food is left on the
spoon. That is a pass for the Spoon Tilt Test. You do not want a lot of food still stuck on the
spoon. If the puree is stuck to the spoon, it could also stick in the mouth and throat.
PRO TIPS | Spoon Tilt Test
• If testing for Level 5 (Minced & Moist), the result should be a moist and cohesive
mound that slides off the spoon. There are no separate dry crumbles. It is
important to avoid dry, crumbly food textures that could get stuck in the mouth or
even go down the wrong way.
• If the food sample did not pass the Spoon Tilt Test, change the recipe and/or add
more sauce, gravy, or condiments to make sure the food is smooth and moist all
throughout. It should be slippery enough to slide off a spoon.
IDDSI Fork Drip Test
The IDDSI Fork Drip Test measures how quickly thicker liquids flow through the tines of a
fork. Level 3 foods and liquids (Liquidised foods and Moderately Thick liquids) drip slowly
through the tines in dollops or strands. By contrast, Level 4 foods and liquids (Pureed foods
and Extremely Thick liquids) sit in a mound on the fork with very little poking through the
tines (maybe a little pokes or peeks through, but it does not drip or flow). This is a great test
when making sauces, gravies, and soups at a Moderately Thick level. You can make sure it
is fully liquidized and does not have lumps or chunks. This can also be useful to make sure
thin liquid is not separating out of a sample of Level 4 food (Pureed) or Level 5 food (Minced
& Moist). Here are the steps:
1. Scoop a sample onto a standard dinner fork.
2. Check to see if it sits in a mound on the fork. Level 4 foods and liquids (Pureed foods
and Extremely Thick liquids) will mound, but Level 3 foods and liquids (Liquidised foods
and Moderately Thick liquids) will not form a mound on top of the fork.
3. Hold the fork up to your eye level to look under the fork.
RESULT: Level 4 foods and liquids (Pureed foods and Extremely Thick liquids) will only
poke or peek through the tines of the fork, with no dripping. Level 3 foods and liquids
(Liquidised foods and Moderately Thick liquids) will only slowly flow or drip in dollops or
strands through the tines of the fork; they will not flow continuously like a thinner liquid.
IDDSI Flow Test
The IDDSI Flow Test uses a standard 10 mL syringe (measuring 61.5 mm from the 0 line to
the 10 mL line), which can be found in any healthcare facility in the United States.
Alternatively, you could use a special IDDSI Funnel that is conveniently marked with each
liquid level (iddsi.org/resources/funnels). The test measures how much liquid flows through
a syringe or IDDSI Funnel in 10 seconds.
Here are the key points to remember:
• It is so important to measure the thickness of the liquid you are drinking to make sure it
matches the level you were recommended (based on your evaluations).
• Test the liquid after making it and before taking it. Liquids thickened with powder thickener
products may thicken up more over time.
• There are other uses for this flow test besides just for the liquids that you drink. Don’t
forget to test liquid medications too, as you do not want to aspirate a liquid medication!
Sauces, gravies, and smoothies/supplements can also be tested with this flow test.
IDDSI Flow Test Instructions:
1. If using a syringe, remove the plunger. If using an IDDSI Funnel, there is no inner
plunger.
2. Hold the syringe or IDDSI Funnel upright in one hand with thumb and index finger.
3. Cover the opening at the bottom of the syringe/funnel with another finger on the same
hand (usually pinky finger or ring finger).
4. Hold the cup of liquid in your other hand and pour liquid into the syringe or funnel up to
the 10 mL mark on the syringe or the fill line on the IDDSI funnel.
5. Remove finger from the bottom opening at the same time as you start a stopwatch with
the other hand.
6. After exactly 10 seconds, return finger to bottom opening, stopping the liquid flow.
RESULT: How much liquid remains in the syringe or IDDSI funnel after 10 seconds of flow?
Slightly Thick, Level 1 = 1 to 4 mL
Mildly Thick, Level 2 = 4 to 8 mL
Moderately Thick, Level 3 = 8 to 10 mL
You cannot test for Level 4 (Pureed foods and Extremely Thick liquids) with this IDDSI Flow
Test. Use the Spoon Tilt Test instead.
PRO TIPS | Flow Test
• You don’t want a result that falls right on the boundary between two levels—1
mL, 4 mL, 8 mL, or 10 mL. For example, if you want a Mildly Thick (Level 2)
liquid, thicken up the liquid a little bit if the Flow Test result is exactly 4 mL. You
want the amount remaining after 10 seconds to be between 4 mL and 8 mL, not
a borderline result.
• If you need Mildly Thick (Level 2) liquids, then your sauce, gravy, broth, and
liquid medications should also be at that level, not Thin liquid (Level 0).
• Keep in mind that thicker is not always better. If you are trying to moisten thick
and sticky pureed potatoes with an Extremely Thick (Level 4) gravy, that may not
work—the puree will not become moist enough. You may only need to thicken
your gravy to Mildly Thick (Level 2). When you mix that into the already sticky
pureed potatoes, that will thin out the puree, producing a slippery, moist, and
smooth puree.
Thickener Variability
The IDDSI Flow Test is extra important due to the variability in thickener products on the
market. Premade packaged thickened liquid products can vary greatly from one company to
another and from one type of liquid to another. For example, the container may claim that
the product is Mildly Thick (Level 2), but the IDDSI Flow Test may reveal that the label is not
so accurate.
Also, when you thicken liquids with powders or gels, the result can vary depending on the
type of liquid. For example, orange juice tends to thicken faster and need less thickener
added than other juices. Also, liquids can continue thickening up over time—you may think
your liquid is too thin, but when it sits for a few minutes, it may thicken more.
Thick liquids also change based on temperature. When a liquid is cold, it is thicker than
when that same liquid is at room temperature or hot. So, if you prepare a cold juice to a
Mildly Thick level, it may thin down to a Slightly Thick level as it warms up.
The type of thickening agent you use will produce varying results, too. If you use
cornstarch-based or modified-food-starch-based thickener powders, the liquid can thin
down too much when it combines with your saliva. Xanthan gum or other gum-based clear
thickener powders and gels are preferable and recommended because they are the most
stable, mix clear in the liquid, and have a better mouthfeel. Cornstarch-based or modified-

food-starch-based thickener powders can feel very gritty in the mouth and make the drink
cloudier.

Choking is when food (or a nonfood object like a marble) drops into the top of the voice
box (larynx) and blocks the airway. This prevents you from breathing. People who are
able to do so may signal that they can’t breathe with hands up to their throat and seek
help immediately. The Heimlich maneuver, to clear the airway in an awake person, can be
done by a trained person. Your CPR training will teach how to give chest compressions
once the person who is choking becomes unresponsive. If you typically eat alone, ask
your medical team to give you other options, as recommending suitable ones is beyond
the scope of this book.
The term safer is used to describe swallowing strategies, as there is typically not one set
of strategies that is perfect and will prevent all risks 100 percent of the time. Strategies
are meant to reduce risks as much as possible; therefore, there may be no one “safest”
option. A treatment plan needs to be customized for you. There is certainly no one-sizefits-all method that works for everyone—that point cannot be stressed enough. Please
review with your medical team all the options that apply to you.

The Puree Kitchen System
As the cost of healthcare facilities rises, more people are choosing to age in
place or to live on their own. If you are living with dysphagia or caring for
someone who is, this means that making pureed food efficiently is a
concern, as it was in my household. I wanted to make delicious pureed
foods, so I experimented with different techniques, ingredients, and cooking
methods to arrive at the most efficient ways of preparing tasty purees at
home.
What worked for me was a combination of a restaurant-style setup in my
kitchen and classic cooking techniques that are perfect for the puree
kitchen. The basic idea is to cook once, puree and store, and then eat
multiple times. If you cook one day a week, this frees up time during the
rest of the week.
For the first two years that I cooked for my mother, I used my home kitchen
as is—a cooktop, an oven, and regular pots and pans. Then I discovered that
the most efficient way to create delicious purees was to set up a basic
cooking and puree station on the counter. Because I did not have to take it
down every day, it was convenient and easy to use several times a day.
Batch cooking—making multiple servings at one time—lightens the
cooking load, as there is always a meal on hand ready to serve. This is
especially helpful if you are busy, are likely to get home late, or need to be
away for a period of time, as meals can continue on schedule without
someone needing to cook every day. All the recipes here make four to six
servings, so you can keep the refrigerator and freezer well stocked.
After I cooked a dish, I found the most helpful technique was to puree one
serving for same-day service, put one serving in the fridge labeled for
service within 48 hours, and label and freeze the remaining servings for use
in the time specified in individual recipes.
Setting Up the Puree Kitchen
Setting up your kitchen for success will make the process of creating meals
run smoothly.
One of the most important aspects of making that process easier is
acquiring the right time- and labor-saving appliances. The two most
important appliances you need are a blender and a mini food processor that
processes at least one or two servings, 3.5 cups. Once you have them, set up
a puree station by placing them side by side on your counter so you can
easily access them. This is your basic working setup—but for versatility, I
recommend investing in some additional appliances and tools, depending
on your budget and space considerations. The list below is a starting point
and general guide. Also keep in mind that new products are always
becoming available.
HOW TO SELECT APPLIANCES
There are a number of factors to consider in the purchase of kitchen appliances.
Reliability and ease of use are the two top qualities you need to think about. Will
the machine do the job that needs to be done? Is it too difficult to figure out? A third
factor is whether you like the machine; sometimes it is worth making an additional
investment so that you are not irritated every time you use it. In the puree kitchen,
you may use a machine three times a day or more, making this an important factor
to consider when purchasing. My guiding principles for product selection are
performance, design, ease of cleanup, and ease of storage. You can buy your
appliances all at once, or add them one at a time.
The Two Most Important Appliances You Will Need
Food Processor
Mini food processors are available in a range of capacities, from 2 to 5
cups. Regular-size food processor capacity ranges from 8 to 14 cups, for
family-size servings. Some brands are also available in fun colors that
brighten up the kitchen. The major brands are available at discount retailers,
at department stores, at specialty stores, and online. I would avoid the leastexpensive models, because you will use this appliance many times a day. A
cheaper model is more likely to burn out sooner, and you will spend more
replacing it than if you had bought a higher-quality one to begin with.
Blender, High-Speed Blender, or Nutrient Extractor
A regular blender is standard equipment for your puree station. You will use
it two or three times a day, so go to a brick-and-mortar store and look at
what’s on display. Choose a machine that you like to use and that is easy to
clean. I highly recommend that you stay away from the type of blender with
a bottom that screws off and blades that need to be cleaned separately.
These are a pain for repeated daily use, as screwing the bottom on and off
just so you can clean the blades is irritating in the extreme.
My favorite high-speed blender is the Vitamix; it is expensive, but it offers
a very good warranty. On the downside, except for one or two smaller
models, a Vitamix blender takes up a lot of space and makes a lot of noise.
That said, they have variable controls, and they blend like no other. In fact,
they are so powerful that their spinning blades create enough friction to heat
the mixture while it blends; that means you can serve a hot soup right from
the blender in just seven minutes. Plus, they are easy to clean—you add a
little dishwashing liquid to the container, turn the machine on for a few
seconds, then rinse. QVC frequently has the best buys on the Vitamix and a
wealth of information online. Amazon sells the Vitamix, and it offers the
option of ordering a refurbished Vitamix at a lower price. They are also
available directly from Vitamix online, with special offers for refurbished
machines and payment plans.
My second-favorite high-speed blender is the Ninja. It has a flat bottom and
a multitiered blade system. I was able to buy a set that included both a small
Ninja and a pitcher-sized Ninja with a vented lid. It is best to visit a store
and take a look, as new models are always coming on the market. There are
many different sets of Ninjas to be found in brick-and-mortar stores as well
as online.
The Ninja Nutri-Blender and the similar Nutribullet are not technically
blenders; they are high-speed nutrient extractors. A nutrient extractor has
such a powerful motor that it will liquefy raw fruits and vegetables by
breaking down the cell wall. This type of appliance gives you control over
the botanical world. If you or the person you are caring for thrives on fresh
fruits and vegetables, this is an appliance to consider adding. They are
fantastic for making smoothies with fruit, including fibrous fruits like
pineapple. I also make use of these when pureeing salads. They puree the
cell wall.
The Nutribullet Rx is a nutrient extractor with a heating function, able to
make soup from raw vegetables in seven minutes. It competes with the
Vitamix at less than half the price. It has a vented lid for safety. It does not
have the variety of settings that the Vitamix does, but it is less noisy than
the Vitamix. This is definitely a convenience appliance. It is excellent for
making a small amount of a dessert, such as pudding (see here), oatmeal, or
Cream of Wheat or farina. I also like to use it for making shakes or soups
that will be served warm.
An immersion blender is convenient for pureeing in the cooking pot without
having to transfer hot liquid to a blender.
WHY YOU NEED A VENTED LID
It is extremely important when blending hot liquids to fill the appliance at most twothirds full and have a lid that can vent the steam. Otherwise pressure builds up and
can blow the top right off the blender or spew the contents all over once you
remove the lid, potentially causing serious burns. It is best to let liquids cool before
attempting to puree.
› TIP: Do not puree hot liquids in a nutrient extractor such as a Nutribullet. It does
not have a vented lid.
Other Useful Appliances
An electric or stovetop pressure cooker is a big timesaver, as it can cook
food to a smooth, moist texture in a very short amount of time. Electric
pressure cookers (including the popular Instant Pot) are computerized and
completely safe. The stovetop models are not quite as convenient, but they
too are easy to use and not as costly.
A slow cooker (or a multicooker with a slow-cook function) is best used for
braising, for making soups and stews, and for anything that needs low heat
and a long cooking time.
An indoor grill is good for safe grilling, low and slow, for the iconic meals
of summer. An outdoor barbecue grill operates at such a high temperature
that it produces charring of food, and charring is not safe for the swallow.
With an indoor grill, you get the flavor and the atmosphere of a cookout, in
modified form.
A steaming appliance or a multitiered steamer can be used in multiple
ways. It is great for steaming an entire head of broccoli or cauliflower
evenly—it gives the best result I have ever had in steaming these veggies.
Steamed vegetables retain their color and nutrients, and are perfect for
making eye-catching purees, such as a carrot soup that is really orange, a
borscht that is really red, and broccoli puree that is bright green. And don’t
forget the parsnip, an overlooked vegetable (a relative of the carrot) that is
quite tasty. When you use a steamer with the parchment parcel technique
(see here), cleanup is quick and easy, with separate servings prepared in a
single cooking session. Steaming is the way you will heat frozen meals. A
multitiered stainless steel steamer, stovetop or electric, is a good choice.
A steamer can be made using a pot fitted with a colander. Not
recommended are steaming baskets with center handles for lifting. Many
companies make steaming appliances. The Instant Pot and other electric
pressure cookers as well as many multicookers come with steaming trays.
Bamboo stacked steamers are not recommended for the dysphagia kitchen
for food safety reasons as they are made of organic material; the
combination of moisture from steaming and organic material can provide
the conditions for bacteria to grow. The steamer is an important tool, so
select the one that is best for your kitchen. Whichever steamer you choose,
ensure that your glass storage dishes can lie flat within it.
When considering which appliances to purchase, try to go to a store that has
the machines on display. You can check out a machine’s size and its
suitability for your space. I also suggest handling the machine to see how it
feels and if it is easy to use. Some stores will even let you plug in a machine
and give it a test run, to see if it is quiet. It is also a good idea to determine
whether you have a place to store the machine when not in use, or enough
counter space for it if you plan to keep it out.
Tools and Utensils
There are quite a few gadgets that can be very helpful in the puree kitchen.
Potato ricer. Once a potato is cooked by any method, it can be put through
a potato ricer. This creates small, grain-like particles that can be mashed
with milk, broth, or cooking liquid to make a smooth puree. You put the
potato in the holder and press the handle down. With a potato ricer, you can
produce velvety mashed potatoes with butter and milk or cream.
Food mill. A food mill can be used with vegetables, soups, and sauces to
produce a very smooth texture with no lumps. You put a small amount of
food in the well of the cone shape and turn the handle. A blade circulates,
forcing the food through the mill, leaving behind the larger particles. This
produces the most glorious gravies and sauces.
Mesh strainers and silicone spatulas. Push any food pureed in a food
processor or a blender through a strainer using a spatula, and any and all
particles not suitable will be left behind. The strainer can also be lined with
cheesecloth beforehand, which works well for removing the tiny seeds from
fruits like strawberries, raspberries, and kiwis.
Cheesecloth. Useful for lining the mesh strainer.
Whisks. Useful for blending instant thickeners and other flavorings into
liquids or purees.
Vegetable peelers. Both the Y-shaped peeler and the traditional straight
variety are great for prepping fresh fruit and vegetables.
Other tools you may find helpful
• A good kitchen scale
• Instant-read thermometer
• Kitchen tongs
• Measuring cups and spoons
• A set of stainless steel mixing bowls, with lids for storage in the fridge
• Electric hand mixer
• Citrus juicer
• Sharp knives—a chef’s knife, a paring knife, and a serrated knife are the
three basics
• A mandoline for even slicing
• Souper cubes for freezing a single serving of soup, gravy, or broth for
later use
• Glass storage containers with lids for storing food in freezer and
reheating by steaming or boiling
• Zip bags, freezer-proof and tightly sealed for heating a serving in boiling
water. Space-saving for storing single servings of whole grains, beans,
and vegetables, because they lie flat
• Whiteboard for keeping track of food on hand.
Batch Cooking Method
The best way to maximize your time is by preparing recipes that make four
to six servings. You can serve one meal right away, put one or more
servings for follow-on service within 48 hours, and/or freeze extra servings
so that you’ll have a good meal on hand for up to 3 months. You or your
loved one will eat deliciously with time freed up. The big secret of batch
cooking: A backup caregiver, whether professional or family member, can
heat and serve a delicious meal for the person with dysphagia. The principal
caregiver gets a night off. The second big secret: The recipes in this
collection may be served to the person who needs a dysphagia diet as well
as other family members. The system is excellent for caregivers.
› Tip: Soups, stews, vegetables, grains, and protein dishes (whether
animal or plant-based) all freeze well. Follow the freezing instructions
for each dish. Label each dish with the day the dish was created and the
USE BY date.
Here is my suggested approach:
1. As suggested previously, ask your loved one with the swallowing
disorder to name ten dishes, their favorites. This list will be the basis of
your cooking schedule. If you are the person with the swallowing
disorder, and you do your own cooking, make a list of your favorites.
2. Plan for one cooking day each week when you make one or two dishes.
This could be an entrée and a side, two sides, or a side and a sauce.
Make different dishes each time you cook, so that you begin to have a
selection in the freezer—for example, pea soup, stuffed cabbage,
chicken pot pie, meat loaf with mashed potato, eggplant parmesan, and
tortellini with pesto. If you cook two dishes one day a week, after five
weeks you will have servings of all ten favorites on hand.
3. Shop for several meals at one time. This may be done a day in advance,
so you have everything on hand and don’t have to run out to the store
right before you start cooking.
4. Once the food is cooked, allow it to cool, then store servings in glass
containers, labeling them as suggested below. As noted, you can serve
one meal right away, store a follow-on meal in the fridge for use within
48 hours, and store the remaining servings in the freezer for use within
3 months.
5. Keep track of the dishes and the number of meals frozen and in the
fridge. When you notice that a particular dish is running low, make
more of it, so that there’s always some on hand. See “Keeping Track of
Meals on Hand”.
Tips for Batch Cooking Day
• Cook what you like to cook. Do what works best for your household.
Every household is different.
• Don’t worry if you make a mistake, especially if a dish is new to you.
You can always save a dish in some way.
• If you need help, get someone to peel the carrots or chop the onions, for
example. Use a food processor as an assistant if necessary.
• Play music while you cook! A playlist enlivens the atmosphere in the
kitchen. Whatever music you like—in my house, some days it’s soul,
some days it’s classical, some days it’s country. To relieve stress, dance
in the kitchen while you cook.
• After initial cooking and cooling, entrees may be pureed and thickened
first, and then frozen. Or they may be frozen in the unpureed state and
then pureed and thickened after defrosting. I prefer the latter because it
preserves the flavor. This is an individual choice, tailored to each
household.
• Keep extra soups and sauces on hand in case a dish needs extra moisture
for the puree. Extremely thick stock may also be used to thicken a
serving. See SimplyThick CEO John Holahan’s TikTok video for
creating Extremely Thick Stock @simplythickjohn. The thickened
liquid cannot be drunk from a cup or sucked through a straw.
FOOD SAFETY
The guidelines for food safety given in this book are drawn from the Food and
Drug Administration website. When the use-by date has gone by, the food is
thrown away, no questions asked. See the Resources section (here) for FDA links.
Food Storage and Labeling
For storing, use glass storage containers with lids. Sets are available in
discount stores like Walmart, Target, and Costco, and online from Amazon.
Best to buy at the holidays when they go on sale in large quantities. Glass
storage containers such as those from Anchor Hocking can go from the
freezer and fridge to the oven and the dishwasher without shattering. Glass
won’t get stained by sauces or absorb strong odors from food, the way
plastic does.
For labeling, some of the newer glass containers have lids that you can
write on. Otherwise, use ruled Post-It labels, writing the name of the dish,
the contents of the dish, and the number of servings (one, unless planning a
family meal). Write whether the dish needs to be pureed or if it has already
been pureed.
Generally, I prefer to store in single servings for food safety. That way there
are no partial servings left over in the fridge that might be overlooked and
allow bacteria to grow.
On the label, also add the date of preparation. For food that will be stored in
the freezer, add a use-by date that is different for every recipe (with
seafood, use a two-week use-by date for servings you freeze).
When freezing baked goods, wrap the baked goods first in plastic wrap and
then in aluminum foil, and put them in a plastic or glass container. I also do
this with purchased cupcakes and birthday cake. (Donna from the bakery at
my local Publix supermarket gave me that tip.)
Keeping Track of Meals on Hand
To keep track of meals, I suggest using two small whiteboards. Put them on
the fridge or freezer door. Mine attach with magnets and have a holder for
the marker (keep erasers close by). I suggest updating the boards every time
you cook and store food, and every time you use food stored in the fridge or
freezer.
On one board, list each main dish, soup, and veggie side dish you have on
hand, and the number of servings. On the other board, list salads, desserts,
savory sauces, and fruit sauces, also with the number of servings. If you
keep it up to date, you and any caregivers will always know what is on hand
and can select from the items available. Everyone’s job is made easier.
Organization is the key to saving labor, time, and money.
When I did a dessert tasting at the New York charity God’s Love We
Deliver, I was pleased to notice that the director of nutrition services, my
host, Lisa Zullig, used the same system of whiteboards to run her amazing
professional kitchen that serves five thousand meals a day to people who
are too sick to cook for themselves. Their motto is “Food Is Medicine, Food
Is Love.” This is an excellent charity and worth your support.
Shopping and Cooking Schedules
Use the whiteboards (mentioned above) to plan your cooking and shopping
schedules. When cooking for my mom, with a glance at the board I could
tell if I’d run out of Split Pea Soup (see here), my mother’s favorite, and
knew that I should plan to make a batch. This system prevents the wasting
of food and money, since you don’t cook too much and you don’t cook too
little. You can see what is on hand and can use the meals that are already
cooked before needing to cook more. This saves time and energy running to
the market.
The Pantry and Freezer
A guiding principle of mine is to always have the makings of a meal on
hand. The way to do this is to keep a well-stocked pantry and a wellstocked freezer. When you need to get a meal ready in as little as half an
hour, having good-quality store-bought convenience foods available in your
pantry makes a huge difference and helps ease the pressures of a busy work
life. Some of my newer recipes are ready in fifteen minutes. I like making
things from scratch, but sometimes I am just too pressed for time. Even
Julia Child admonished that it is best not to be a food snob!
The pantry is also important should there be an emergency. For example, I
live in the land of hurricanes, and emergency management agencies suggest
that households whose members have medical needs should keep two
weeks’ worth of food, water, and medicines on hand, in case the power goes
out in a storm.
Pantry Checklist
Tomato products. Canned or jarred tomatoes are a must. Many of the
recipes in this book call for tomato paste, tomato puree, tomato sauce, or
diced tomatoes. I suggest having some of each on hand—the low-sodium
varieties are best. I also suggest looking for the tubes of tomato paste rather
than the cans. Some supermarkets offer a house brand of delicious organic
tomato products, including fire-roasted tomato paste and diced tomatoes.
These can be used to add a lot of flavor to dishes.
Also look for jars of your favorite pre-made tomato sauce when they are on
sale and stock up, as well as jarred Alfredo sauce to use as a base for the
lemon sauce for the Salmon in Puff Pastry (see here). When buying storebought tomato sauce, I look for one that lists tomatoes as the first
ingredient, as I find they have better flavor than the ones that list tomato
puree as the first ingredient. I like to make a big pot of homemade tomato
sauce on Sunday that I can freeze or use during the week. (I am developing
a recipe for an easy homemade Alfredo, made without butter and cream.)
Pasta. Keep a variety of pasta shapes—for example, thin spaghetti,
linguine, penne, and elbow macaroni. I prefer whole-grain pasta. A new
discovery of mine is black bean pasta and adzuki bean pasta. Both are
flavorful additions to pasta dishes and are gluten free. Japanese soba
noodles can be used in soups flavored with dashi (an instant granulated
form is available for making this traditional Japanese broth). Soba noodles
are made from buckwheat. They puree beautifully and can be served with
steamed vegetables and a protein like shrimp, chicken, or tofu.
Legumes and beans. I keep dried peas and French lentils on hand for
making my mother’s favorite pea soup. I also like to stock up on packages
of nine-bean soup mix from the health food store. Keep a variety of canned
beans on hand—they are useful additions to meals and soups, and are easily
combined with rice, as in red beans and rice, for a healthy side or main dish.
The best beans to keep on hand are cannellini or white beans, red kidney
beans for chili, black beans for tacos, and chickpeas for soups and even
making falafel. Dried chickpeas can be cooked easily in a pressure cooker,
then used as needed or made into hummus.
Whole grains. Long-grain brown basmati rice is my go-to rice because of
the flavor, and because it gets very tender after cooking. It does not have a
tough husk, as short-grain brown rice does; short-grain brown rice can be
difficult to digest. I keep kasha (buckwheat groats) on hand, too, along with
quinoa, a high-protein whole grain native to South America that can be used
in place of rice as a side dish or to stuff peppers or cabbage. Farro is a new
favorite of mine. I prefer steel-cut oats for oatmeal (the 5-minute variety as
opposed to the 30-minute variety). Barley is an excellent grain to use as a
side dish or in soups.
USING READY-MADE MEALS
My friend Betsy is a member of the “sandwich generation”—someone with aging
parents, growing children, and a full-time job. She called me in a panic when her
mother had to go on a pureed diet as a result of a neurological disorder related to
aging. Betsy was the manager of the health food store where I shopped, and she
and her staff had helped me with selecting food for my own mom. Betsy knew that
I was the queen of puree. She had siblings who were willing to help but she
needed a simple solution.
Here are a few of the ideas I suggested to her:
• Buy the nutritionally best available prepared frozen food items. Thaw, prepare,
and puree them.
• Buy ready-to-prepare meal kits (fresh or frozen) from the grocery store or a
delivery service. Thaw if needed, prepare, and puree.
Today many people have prepared meals delivered to their homes. These services
are more expensive than cooking meals at home, but for some households, they
are a necessity. Many meal plans are competitive with or cheaper than grocery
store prices and may fit some family budgets. The convenience can free up extra
caregiver hours. If you have a lower income and are eligible for Medicaid, you may
be eligible to receive home-delivered pureed meals on a monthly basis.
Prepackaged mixes. Pancakes are easy to make from scratch, but
sometimes you don’t have time. Packaged buckwheat pancake mixes and
instant pudding mixes can be kept on hand. Please see the recipe for
Homemade Vanilla Pudding Mix (here).
Baking supplies. Unbleached flour, cornstarch, arrowroot, and Wondra
flour can all be used for thickening sauces and gravies. Prepared
breadcrumbs (my choice is organic whole wheat with Italian seasoning),
matzo meal, and panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs) can be used for light
breading. These all puree well without granules that irritate the throat and
make swallowing difficult. Jacques Pépin has a secret ingredient for
thickening soups—potato starch. Easier than making a roux or a slurry.
Spices, seasonings, herb pastes, and condiments. It’s nice to have a
variety of spices on hand, including cumin, oregano, thyme, tarragon, sage,
turmeric, curry powder, and chili powder. For desserts, real vanilla extract,
cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and allspice are great to have. The dysphagia
kitchen uses white pepper. Black pepper is to be avoided, as it has sharp
edges and is not safe for the swallow. I use Adriatic sea salt because it is
available online and in some natural foods stores, has great flavor, and is
reasonably priced. The reason I choose sea salt, generally, is because it has
a fine texture, unlike kosher salt and other chunky salts, and it dissolves
easily. It is excellent for the puree kitchen.
Old Bay Seasoning is a must for fish and shellfish. Worcestershire sauce,
Tabasco sauce, and low-sodium soy sauce are flavor powerhouses. Herb
pastes like those made with parsley, basil, and ginger are easy to use and
good to keep on hand in the fridge. I like having several varieties of
mustard in the pantry—yellow mustard, Dijon mustard, and Chinese
mustard (avoid grainy mustard for safe swallow reasons). Low-fat
mayonnaise, Lemonaise, or any mayo substitute is useful to have. For
ketchup, I prefer the organic kinds that are low in sugar. These are easy to
find in a supermarket. Stubb’s Bar-B-Q sauce is also low in sugar; there are
four varieties and all of them are good. Annie’s brand is also low-sugar.
Oils and vinegars. Keep good-quality olive oil and extra-virgin olive oil on
hand for salads and sauces. I use extra-virgin olive oil for cooking; it is a bit
more expensive but the nutritional profile is good. (See Dr. Willett’s book
for a thorough discussion of oils.) The reader may use regular olive oil,
however. For other oils, I prefer cold-pressed (avocado and sunflower are
good; grapeseed oil has a high smoke point). Rice vinegar is light and has a
clean taste without the acidic afterburn. Red wine vinegar and sherry
vinegar are good to have on hand, too, but use them in moderation, as acidic
foods may cause aspiration.
Sweeteners. My favorites are the following: any local honey, real maple
syrup, barley malt syrup, agave syrup, and stevia—but consult with your
healthcare provider about what would be preferred choices for you.
Freezer Checklist
Fruit. Stock up on packages of frozen fruit like blueberries, strawberries,
raspberries, pineapple, black cherries, and mango—all great to have on
hand for making fruit purees. You can use just a few pieces at a time. As
frozen vegetables and fruits are picked at the height of ripeness and flash
frozen, they make an excellent choice when fresh is not available, or when
you don’t have time to go to the market.
Vegetables. Packages of chopped spinach, corn, and peas, plus pureed
vegetables like butternut squash and turnips (I like the Birds Eye Southland
brand) are good to keep stocked. Choose the ones that work for your family.
Meat and seafood. Cooked peeled shrimp (sold with the tail on, but
remove the tail before pureeing), scallops, wild salmon fillets, ground
turkey, chicken breasts, and chicken sausage (mild Italian-style) are good
choices. Pork loin keeps well and is handy to have in your freezer.
Desserts. There is a need for imagination when it comes to desserts in the
dysphagia kitchen. See the recipe for Instant Pudding Mix (here). Plain ice
cream is the easiest dessert, but the same old flavors get boring. For variety,
see How to Thicken Ice Cream (here) and eliminate items that are not safe
for the swallow.

Before You Start
Introduction
The recipes that follow are updated family recipes developed over the years
that I was taking care of my mother. Providing food that tasted good and
allowed her to maintain a healthy weight was one of my main goals. Now
my hope is that sharing what I learned and the recipes I developed will give
you guidelines and inspiration for making delicious food when you or a
family member is faced with swallowing difficulties: Food that offers
quality nutrition to help maintain a good immune system. Food that
improves your mood. Food that can be made in the home kitchen.
The recipes in this book are suitable for Pureed, IDDSI Level 4, through
Regular, Level 7 (the Shakes are suitable for Level 3, Moderately Thick
Liquid). For detailed instructions on how to create and test for each level,
please see the IDDSI materials, text, and charts in Karen Sheffler’s chapter,
here.
To achieve IDDSI Level 5, Minced & Moist, chop items to the right particle
size (particle size compliance) and ensure that the pebbly particles are
moist/cohesive enough to pass the IDDSI tests (see here) and bind together.
Before we get to the actual recipes, here are a few helpful ideas, reminders,
and procedures for making them as safe as possible, as appetizing as
possible, and as appealing as possible.
Thickeners
Any individual diagnosed with dysphagia requires a healthcare plan that is
tailored to the results of a swallow test. Your healthcare provider will
identify the level of the IDDSI framework for food and beverages that is
suitable for your particular situation. To use the recipes that follow, create
the dish, thicken to the prescribed IDDSI level if needed, and run the IDDSI
test for the dish. For detailed information, refer to the IDDSI section
(starting here).
The thickeners used for food and beverages are available in powdered and
gel forms. They are sold in pharmacies or can be bought online directly
from the manufacturer, from other sources like Carewell Home Health
Products, or from major online retailers.
Additionally, manufacturers have created educational materials and posted
them on their websites. These materials include well-researched and
illustrated webpages and instructional videos showing how to use the
products (see Resources).
There are other items that you can use to thicken dishes in addition to a
commercial thickening agent, such as flour, regular cornstarch, pureed
potatoes, sauces, or gravy.
WHEN USING THICKENERS, KEEP IN MIND
Closely follow the directions on the label of your chosen thickener.
Use glass containers for storage when possible, because thickened liquids cling to
plastic containers.
Gum-based thickeners work in all liquids and do not add a starchy, pasty flavor.
Powdered thickeners take time to hydrate and to make your beverages safe for
consumption. After mixing, allow them to stand for three to five minutes to achieve
full thickening potential.
As noted earlier, I recommend storing food in individual servings for convenience
and for safety. There will be no leftovers to store and less chance of developing
bacteria. And since loss of appetite may occur with dysphagia, there will be less
waste.
› TIP: Thicken the dish and then store in individual servings. The idea is that a
backup caregiver may serve a meal. To get a night off for the primary caregiver,
it helps to have a dish that either a professional caregiver or a family or friend
who is serving as caregiver can heat and serve. In my own case, certified
nursing assistants (CNAs) sent from an agency were not allowed to do any
cooking, but were allowed to prepare a heat-and-serve meal.
The Importance of Sauces: Making Great-Tasting Purees
Good-tasting sauces, homemade or store-bought, are the key to delicious
pureed food. Why? The surface area of the ingredients is greatly increased
when the food is pureed, and that can result in a loss of flavor; suspending
the pureed food in a sauce adds more flavor back. The sauce also adds
color, nutrients, and texture to the final dish. My mother liked sweets, so I
discovered that using ice cream as a sauce in pureeing desserts like cake
worked nicely, as did using fruit sauces for pureeing pancakes and pies. The
idea is to maximize flavor and visual appeal.
The Importance of Snacks
Healthy snacks with nutritional density are important additions to the diet if
you have a swallowing disorder. You need calories, because if you do not
maintain a healthy weight, you may be less able to fight off infections.
Those on a pureed diet can lose weight because some of the functions of
digestion, such as the breakdown of the food by mastication, are performed
by the pureeing of the food. Also, a person with a diminished appetite may
only want to eat small meals, so snacks can be useful. There are a variety of
shakes suitable for sweet snacks (see here). For savory snacks, I suggest
soups (see here), especially quick soups that can be made with a high-speed
blender. You can also thicken servings of store-bought soup.
HOW TO MAKE A SUPER SHAKE USING SUPPLEMENTS
To boost nutrition, a snack shake may be fortified with supplements—super
ingredients. Check with your healthcare professional before adding supplements to
make sure that the supplement does not conflict with any medications. Among the
nutrients most often missing are minerals, but you must be able to tolerate them,
and they must not interfere with other medications—be sure to discuss with your
healthcare team. Some supplements to consider are liquid vitamins, liquid colloidal
minerals, protein powder (whey or plant-based), and probiotics for digestive health.
If you use supplements, add them when blending the shake. At the suggestion of
my mother’s primary care physician, I added one supplement at a time, generally
vitamins in the morning and minerals in the afternoon, for ease of absorption.
I have just taste-tested a product called Thrive Ice Cream that is already fortified
and is shipped on dry ice. Made of excellent ingredients, the ice cream comes in
three flavors as well as a no-sugar-added vanilla suitable for diabetics. It has great
flavor and may be added to a shake without mixing in supplements separately. See
thriveicecream.com/products/thrive-ice-cream/. Thrive also makes four flavors of
Thrive Gelato. These have excellent flavor and texture.
Cooking Tips for Making Favorite Ethnic, Family, or Regional
Recipes
The IDDSI system of describing the texture of modified foods and
thickened liquids for people with swallowing disorders is used all over the
world, for every ethnic cuisine. An amazing variety of cuisines make up the
food landscape. All of them may be modified and pureed using the system
in this book. The source of the recipe may be a family recipe, a wellreviewed cookbook on the cuisine, or takeout food. A discussion with your
healthcare provider is recommended so that you can review the ingredients
and cooking techniques. Additional materials on ethnic cuisines may be
found on the IDDSI website.
The standard rules for puree apply to cooking techniques in other ethnic
kitchens. Here, for example, I show how you can create purees for classic
southern food family favorites. These techniques can also be used for other
family-favorite cuisines.
1. Choosing a recipe. Choose a recipe with a tender protein and a sauce or
liquid. Oxtail soup is a great example. The perfect recipe for puree
renders food moist and tender while preserving nutrients. In the case of
oxtail soup, long cooking renders a less expensive cut of meat soft and
tender. Another example is barbecued ribs—cook them first in an
electric pressure cooker with a mild sauce following directions for your
appliance. Once the protein is cooked, go to step 2.
2. Prepping proteins. After cooking, prep the protein for pureeing. Make
sure when removing the meat from the bones to eliminate any sinews,
tendons, or connective tissue, as these do not puree. For this process,
use a mesh strainer and a silicone spatula. Sometimes you can dig a
little marrow out of the bones. This provides not just nutrition but also
flavor and richness, so add it to the puree. Legumes can be a great
protein source, too—a holiday favorite for New Year’s is black-eyed
peas that have been simmered for a long time, until they are soft and
perfect for the dysphagia kitchen.
3. Prepping veggies. All skins, seeds, and fibrous parts of any vegetable
must be removed from the final puree. The best way to do this is to run
the puree through a mesh strainer with a silicone spatula to eliminate
any parts that might not be safe for the swallow. If your sweet potatoes
are fibrous, for example, run them through the strainer. Prep collard
greens by removing the ribs and tough stems, as these will not puree.
Use a high-speed blender or a nutrient extractor for vegetables that are
more resistant, like green beans or lima beans. This will liquefy the
veggies, which can then be thickened. Be sure to strain out whole
spices used in cooking. Corn needs special treatment, as the outside of
the kernels is very tough. If using fresh corn, remove the kernels from
the cob and cook them until soft, then place in a high-speed blender to
break down the kernels. Remove from the blender and push through a
mesh strainer using a silicone spatula to remove any remaining tough
bits. A substitute for corn is polenta.
Eating with Your Eyes
To make pureed food look good, I recommend serving it on colorful plates
in interesting shapes—look for fun plates at retail outlets, garage sales, flea
markets, consignment shops, and thrift stores. You can make a plate of food
even more visually tempting by piping (a technique used in pastry-making)
the pureed food to make different shapes or designs (see here).
Integrative Medicine and Nutrition
Integrative medicine, or functional medicine, is based on the idea that
nutrition can promote health. In recent years Western medicine has begun to
recognize some of the principles of Eastern medicine, like traditional
Chinese medicine (TCM), which has a clinical history of several thousand
years, and Ayurvedic medicine.
TO CHEFS AT HEALTHCARE FACILITIES:
These recipes may be used for healthcare facilities in the following manner: Using
a standard conversion chart, convert the recipe to be used to metric
measurements. Scale up the recipe to the desired size by multiplying the metric
measurements by the number of servings you want. The chef should then modify
the temperature and time for cooking. A freelance chef from a cooking school could
also be hired to do the upscale or simply to figure the temperature and time of
cooking and the cooking vessel to be used.
TCM recognizes three categories in relation to food, all of which are
equally important:
1. The science of nutrition, meaning what is in the food should be good for
you. In this system, ingredients are selected for nutritional healing.
2. The preparation of food, which includes cooking, plating, and serving.
One technique is to engage the senses to compensate for the loss of the
swallow. I used to show my mom the beautiful vegetables selected for
her meals. She could smell the dish while it was cooking. I showed her
the whole dish before it was pureed. The meal became something she
could see unfolding, rather than the presentation of a pureed dish.
3. The context in which the meal is eaten—the people with whom a meal
is eaten, the conversation during the meal, the environment in which
the food is eaten. From the standpoint of the Western tradition, this is
the most unusual of the three categories. A friend who is a practitioner
of TCM told me, “One of the teachers I have known and respected for a
long time emphasizes the importance of context from a standpoint of
health benefits in a meal. This teacher often stated that context was as
important or more important than the food itself. The idea of
connecting with family and friends, of having conversation, of the
environment and surroundings of the meal is as important or sometimes
even more important because these elements of a meal are nourishing
too.”
The meal is not only what is on the plate. We take in our surroundings and
what we know about the ingredients and the preparation. We eat with our
minds and hearts. This approach is welcome when dealing with swallowing
difficulties. Creating an environment of health and healing does not take
much. It is an attitude.
How to Make a Beautiful Plate Using
Piping Techniques
BY ANDREW CULLUM
The iddsi Guy
Why is it so important to make IDDSI-modified meals smell and taste
wonderful?
Here’s the answer. When we eat or think about eating, our brain and senses
kick in. Recognizing foods and smells can spark memories of enjoyable
meals had with family or friends.
When we eat, our senses come into play. The smell of food cooking
stimulates the brain and taste buds before we even see the food. We can all
remember the smell of freshly baked bread.
Visual appearance gives the brain information about the food and what we
should be expecting. Not recognizing a food may be confusing and may
have a negative impact on eating. As the saying goes, we eat with our eyes.
Color helps us recognize a dish, but we try not to make color distracting.
For example, mixing colors can lead to disaster even if the taste is lovely.
So while color is important, we must get the balance right so we can focus
on what is in front of us.
Shape is a hallmark for recognition. A round shape for meat, for example, is
reminiscent of a hamburger. Making shapes is easily done, but you will
need to put some thought into your presentation.
As for taste, the first mouthful is so important. When modifying foods,
always taste the food for seasoning. If the food is bland, the person with the
swallowing disorder will probably lose interest, as anyone would.
The meal should be presented with attention and care. You do not have to
be the best cook in the world if the person can feel the love you have put
into the meal. This will then make the dining experience memorable.
Finally, mealtimes are important not only for the nutrition they provide.
Meals are also social occasions (with attention to safe practices).
How to Pipe
Piping is done by squeezing the puree from a thick disposable pastry bag to
create shapes on the plate or bowl. For example, you can pipe rose shapes
for mashed potatoes or pureed vegetables, dots of pureed peas, rectangles of
pureed sweet potato, and lines of sauces and gravy for dipping.
You can pipe using metal tips, available in cooking stores, or you can mold
food into shapes, but piping with a zip bag is the easiest, especially for
beginners.
Equipment
You need a heavy-duty pastry bag suitable for warm food. These bags are
available in cooking supply stores, restaurant supply stores, craft stores, and
online. Amazon is a good source for bulk buying. You can use the piping
bag with the corner snipped off to pipe. You can also buy tips that create
different shapes.
A good brand of metal tips and other equipment, such as a rack for holding
the plastic bags and tips bought separately or in a Decorator Set, is
Celebrate It, available at Michael’s in the cooking section
(www.michaels.com/product/disposable-decorating-bags-by-celebrate-it10051561?michaelsstore=9946&inv=4). Other brands are available online
at Amazon.
Having the tools on hand is a great way to involve children and young
adults in meal prep for family members.
Technique
Fill the pastry bag with the puree to be piped. To fill the pastry bag, lower it
into a tall glass or vase and fold the edges of the bag over the rim. This will
hold it in place for hands-free filling.
Before piping, cut the tip off the pastry bag. Create puree shapes on the
plate by gently squeezing the bag.
Suggestions for Shapes
Round shapes suggest a steak or a hamburger. A fillet shape suggests fish. A
curve suggests shrimp. There are no limits to what you can create on the
plate using your imagination. You can create stripes, straight or wiggly.
Sausage shapes piped next to one another are very good for proteins. Use
your imagination to make an appetizing plate.
For a smear look, find a spatula in your kitchen, squeeze a dollop of the
desired puree onto the plate, and using a light touch, wand the spatula over
the food to create a smooth look. This is good for sauces. Dip the spoonful
of puree into the sauce, and enjoy!
Try using a 2-ounce ice cream scoop or two spoons to dollop the puree into
small mounds on the plate. This creates the look of mashed potato.

Serving
The dishes shown in the photos accompanying the recipes that follow are
IDDSI Level 7. Please use the IDDSI instructions (here) to modify the
texture of each dish to the individual IDDSI level prescribed by your
healthcare provider. Please refer to Andrew Cullum’s section (here) on
piping to create a beautiful plate.
The recipes that follow allow for serving right away to yourself, to the
person with dysphagia, or to family and friends. Generally, if not serving
immediately, divide the extra servings (the beauty of the batch-cooking
method!) between freezer- and oven-safe glass storage dishes. Allow to cool
completely, cover, and refrigerate for up to 48 hours or freeze for up to 3
months (exceptions noted in individual recipes).
When you wish to serve a dish from the freezer, I recommend heating the
servings by using a stovetop multitiered stainless steel pot or a steaming
appliance.
1. For the steamer, add water to your steamer; for stovetop, put water in a
pot to boil and place a colander or steamer basket in the pot.
2. Bring water to a low boil and place your covered food storage dishes in
the steamer or in the pot (cover the pot) and steam for 30 minutes. Be
careful about escaping steam.
3. Use gloves or a pair of tongs to remove the dishes from the steamer or
pot. Let cool for five minutes, and test the internal temperature of the
food (it should be 165°F [75°C].)
When serving from thawed, heat the servings using a steamer appliance or
the above stovetop method, but the steaming time needed to come to the
required internal temperature might be shorter.
Alternately, you can use a boil-in-bag method for storing and heating
individual servings.
1. Use watertight zip bags, or vacuum-sealed bags instead of glass storage
dishes to store the finished servings. (You can find inexpensive suction
vacuum units at discount retailers; I suggest using a cake-decorating
rack to hold the bags upright to make filling them easier.)
2. Place a bag in a stockpot filled with several quarts of water and boil
until the dish reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C).
Steamed Parchment Parcels
Cooking with this technique is the essence of easy meal prep. It’s quick, it’s
simple and fuss-free, making it ideal for busy times. Follow the steps below
to learn how to use this method to combine your favorite fish, or another
protein, with veggies and seasonings in one delicious package. See also Cod
and Vegetable Parcels, here.
1. Ask the person who is eating the dish to name their favorite proteins.
Some suggestions: tuna, cod, or salmon; thinly sliced pieces of chicken
breast; shrimp or scallops.
2. Shop the day before—get enough to make five servings (allow 4 to 6
ounces per serving, depending on the appetite).
3. Cut five 12 x 12-inch squares of parchment paper (aluminum foil can
also be used).
4. If needed, cut the chosen protein into servings. Season lightly with salt
and pepper.
5. Place one serving of protein on each of the parchment paper squares.
6. Add aromatics like grated ginger, garlic, or thinly sliced scallion. If
desired, add veggies like carrots, zucchini, or red pepper, cut into
matchsticks.
7. Make a parchment parcel by folding the paper in half to enclose the
portions and crimping the edges all around to seal.
8. Place the parcels in a steamer and cook for the number of minutes
required for the chosen protein.
9. Remove the parcels from the steamer using tongs, place on a plate, and
allow to cool.
10. When cooled, the contents of each parcel can be pureed and thickened.
11. Store 1 or 2 servings in the fridge for serving within 48 hours. Store the
rest in the freezer for serving within 1 month. (See Serving, here.)
12. Serve with a sauce thickened to the prescribed IDDSI level (see here),
either on the side or added on top. Suggested sauces: lemon butter,
pesto, remoulade, marinara, barbecue, curry, or Alfredo.

Roasted Tomato Soup
SERVINGS: 4-6 | IDDSI LEVELS
This vibrant soup is best made in summer, at the height of
tomato season. Choose the ripest small to medium tomatoes
available. When tomatoes are not in season, a good
substitution is a 28-ounce can of roasted or whole peeled
tomatoes, crushed by hand before being added to the soup.
As a shortcut, or when I don’t have fresh herbs on hand, I
use a store-bought herb paste. It purees smoothly and adds
great flavor.
3 pounds cherry, grape, or plum
tomatoes, halved
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil,
divided
½ teaspoon sea salt
⅛ teaspoon white pepper
1 large onion, sliced
4 garlic cloves, sliced
2½ cups low-sodium vegetable broth
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil or basil
paste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley or
parsley paste
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400°F (205°C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the halved tomatoes
on the baking sheet, cut side up.
2. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and white
pepper. Transfer the sheet pan to the oven and roast until the tomatoes
have collapsed and are lightly caramelized, about 30 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over
medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté until softened and just
beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for 1
more minute. Add the roasted tomatoes along with their juices, the
vegetable broth, and the herbs, and stir to combine.
4. Remove the pot from the heat. Working in batches, transfer the soup to a
blender, filling the pitcher only two-thirds full and venting the lid.
Blend until smooth.
5. Run each batch of blended soup through a mesh strainer set over a large
bowl to collect any skins and seeds. Discard the skins and seeds. Set
aside servings for family meals, if desired.
6. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
7. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here.

intense flavor. I use Gourmet Garden Herb Pastes in my recipes—
they are convenient, as they can be stored in the refrigerator and are
already pureed.
If using dried herbs, make sure they have softened in the cooking
process. To remove pieces of herbs, run the puree through a mesh
strainer lined with cheesecloth using a silicone spatula.

Matzo Ball Soup
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
The secret to these tender matzo balls lies in the addition of
beaten egg whites and room-temperature club soda. Frozen
matzo balls are available in the international freezer section
of the supermarket, but this homemade recipe is so much
more delicious.
FOR THE MATZO BALLS
½ cup matzo meal*
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley or
parsley paste (optional)
¼ teaspoon sea salt
⅛ teaspoon white pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons low-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons club soda, at room
temperature
1 large egg white
If matzo meal isn’t available, break up five matzo crackers, place in a mini food processor,
and pulse until the crackers turn into a fine meal. This should yield ½ cup.
To make the matzo balls
1. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the matzo meal, parsley, salt, and
pepper. Add the oil, broth, and club soda, and stir to combine.
2. In a separate small bowl, whisk the egg white until frothy, about 1
minute. Add the egg white to the matzo ball mixture and mix well.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
3. Once the matzo ball mix has rested, in a large pot, bring 2 quarts of
water to a gentle boil. Using wet hands or a 1-inch ice cream scoop,
form 1-inch matzo balls. Take care to handle the matzo balls gently and
pack them loosely; this is the secret to making them tender.
4. Gently slide the matzo balls into the boiling water and cook, uncovered,
for about 20 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove one matzo ball; cut
it open to make sure it is cooked through. Once they are done cooking,
transfer the remaining matzo balls to a plate.
FOR THE SOUP
1 quart low-sodium chicken broth
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken
breasts
2 carrots, peeled and cut into rounds
2 parsnips, peeled and cut into rounds
½ yellow onion
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley or
parsley paste
1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill or dill
paste
To make the soup
1. In a soup pot, combine the broth, chicken, carrot, parsnip, onion, and
herbs. Bring the broth to a boil, then lower to a simmer. Simmer until
the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are soft, about 15
minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
2. Transfer the chicken breasts to a cutting board and cut into 1-inch
cubes. Remove and discard the onion.
3. Set aside any family servings before pureeing, adding matzo balls,
carrots, and parsnips to each serving.
4. For the puree, add 4 ounces chicken breast per serving to a blender or
food processor. Pulse a few times to chop the chicken, add 2 matzo
balls, ¼ cup broth, and a few pieces of carrot and parsnip, and blend
until smooth, adding additional broth, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed
to achieve a smooth puree.
5. Transfer the blended portions to a bowl. Test as you go and at time of
serving to see if a thickening agent, thickened sauce, or thickened stock
is needed; use IDDSI Testing Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the
desired IDDSI level. See here.
6. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here.

Split Pea Soup
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
This vegetarian version of split pea soup omits the
traditional ham hock. In its place is cumin, which imparts a
smoky depth of flavor, and soy sauce for savoriness. I buy
organic French lentils and split peas at a health food store
because they are fresher in bulk.
¾ cup split peas
¼ cup French lentils
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, diced
2 carrots, halved lengthwise and sliced
into half moons
1 garlic clove, sliced
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
½ teaspoon cumin
¼ teaspoon dried thyme
⅛ teaspoon white pepper
4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
⅛ teaspoon sea salt
1. Place the split peas and lentils in a medium bowl, cover with cold water,
and let sit for at least 1 hour. Drain the peas and lentils and rinse them
in a mesh strainer, picking through to remove any stones. Set aside.
2. In a large pot, warm the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion
and sauté until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add carrots and sauté for 3
minutes. Add garlic and sauté, stirring, for 1 more minute. Add the soy
sauce, cumin, thyme, and white pepper, and cook for another 30
seconds.
3. Add the peas, lentils, and broth, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and
simmer, skimming and discarding foam, until the peas and lentils are
very soft, about 1 hour. If the soup thickens too much, add a splash of
water. Season with salt, stir, and remove from the heat.
4. Working in batches, transfer the soup to a blender, filling the pitcher
only two-thirds full and venting the lid. Blend until smooth, transferring
each batch to a large bowl. Set aside any servings for family meals.
5. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if thickening is needed; use
IDDSI Testing Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI
level. See here.

Wonton Soup
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
This homemade version of a classic takeout favorite
contains protein, green veggies, and carbs, with far less
sodium than takeout. You can also add extra cooked
vegetables to the puree for a nutritional boost.
1 quart low-sodium chicken broth
1 (½-inch) piece ginger, or 1 teaspoon
ginger paste
2 scallions, sliced thinly on the bias
½ teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce
2 cups fresh spinach
2 packages gluten-free chicken or
vegetable potstickers*
8 ounces roast pork loin (see here),
sliced into matchsticks
Different brands of potstickers have different numbers per package. To make sure you
have enough, buy two packages. Hint: Try to buy the brand with the thinnest pastry
wrapping. Too much dough makes for a gummy puree.
1. In a soup pot, bring the broth to a boil. Lower to a simmer and add the
ginger, scallions, and soy sauce. Simmer for 2 minutes. Add the spinach
and simmer for another 2 minutes, just until the spinach is wilted and
bright green.
2. Remove the soup from the heat. Allow it to cool slightly. If using fresh
ginger, remove and discard it.
3. Prepare the potstickers according to the package instructions.
4. Set aside any family servings of soup before pureeing, and serve with
the potstickers and sliced pork.
5. For the puree, place 2 ounces of pork in a food processor or blender.
Pulse 5 times to chop up the pork. Add 2 tablespoons broth and process
until smooth. Add 3 potstickers per serving, and pulse to puree until
smooth. Add the scallions, spinach, and 1 cup broth, and blend until
completely smooth.
6. Return the puree to the pot with the remaining broth. Test as you go and
at time of serving to see if a thickening agent, thickened sauce, or
thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing Methods (iddsi.org) to
help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
7. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here.

Mushroom Barley Soup
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
I made mushroom barley soup for my mother with chicken
or vegetable stock, but you can use beef stock if you prefer.
Served with a salad, this makes a lovely lunch. I like the
flavor of baby Bella mushrooms, also known as cremini, but
you can use any variety of mushrooms you prefer.
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
4 scallions, or ½ yellow onion, sliced
2 carrots, halved lengthwise and sliced
into ¼-inch half moons
1 pound baby Bella or cremini
mushrooms, quartered
1 cup pearl barley, rinsed
6 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1. In a large sauté pan, warm the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the
scallions and sauté until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the carrots and
sauté 3 more minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring
occasionally, until they soften, release their liquid, and turn a light
golden brown, about 10 minutes. If they begin to brown too quickly,
lower the heat to medium. Add the barley and stir to coat the grains in
the oil.
2. Add the broth, bring the soup to a boil, and lower to a simmer. Cook,
skimming any light foam that rises to the surface of the pot, until the
barley is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat. Set aside any
family servings before pureeing.
3. For the puree, working in batches, transfer the soup to a blender, filling
the pitcher only two-thirds full and venting the lid. Blend until smooth,
transferring each blended batch to a large bowl.
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.

Chawan Mushi (Japanese Teacup
Soup)
SERVINGS: 1 | IDDSI LEVELS
Chawan means “teacup” in Japanese—this Japanese egg
custard soup is traditionally steamed and served in a small
teacup. The custard has a soft and delicate texture and is
comforting and tasty. The vegetables and proteins are pureed
before they are added to the custard, so once the soup has
been steamed and cooled, it is ready to eat. These
instructions call for a steamer basket, but you can also use
an electric pressure cooker with a steam setting, For the
broth, you can also use Japanese broths such as dashi or
miso.
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
4 ounces cooked chicken breast, cut into
cubes
4 cooked shrimp, tails removed
¼ cup sliced button mushrooms, wiped
with a damp paper towel
2 tablespoons grated or julienned carrots
2 scallions, thinly sliced
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth,
vegetable broth, or dashi
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce
1. Add the oil to a small sauté pan over medium heat. Add the chicken,
shrimp, mushrooms, carrots, and scallions and sauté, stirring
occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 3 minutes. Add
the proteins and vegetables to a food processor or high-speed blender,
along with 2 tablespoons broth. Puree until smooth.
2. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs. Add the remaining broth, the puree,
and the soy sauce, and whisk to combine. Pour the mixture into a
ramekin.
3. Add 2 inches of water to the bottom of a stockpot fitted with a steamer
basket. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat so the
water is at a simmer.
4. Place the filled ramekin in the steamer basket, cover the pot, and steam
undisturbed until the eggs are set and a toothpick inserted into the
custard comes out clean, about 12 minutes. Allow to cool before
serving.
5. Serve immediately. (I do not suggest freezing this.)

Celery Root Remoulade
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Celery root, or celeriac, may look gnarly and bumpy in the
produce section, but ignore its appearance. When julienned,
or sliced into thin matchsticks, and dressed with Pink
Remoulade, you get a vibrant take on the classic French
salad.
1 small celery root (about 1 pound),
peeled and trimmed
¼ cup Pink Remoulade (see here)
1. Using a knife, a mandoline, a handheld julienning tool, or a food
processor fitted with a julienne disc, slice the celery root into thin
matchsticks.
2. Add the matchsticks to a bowl and toss with the Pink Remoulade. Set
aside any servings for family meals that are not to be pureed, cover, and
refrigerate until ready to serve.
3. For the puree, transfer the remaining mixture to a blender and process
until you achieve the desired texture. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time
as needed (you want to avoid adding too much water and diluting the
flavor of the salad).
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,

Red Beet Salad with Ranch Dressing
SERVINGS: 2 | IDDSI LEVELS
Beets are a nutritional powerhouse, and fermented foods are
good for the human gut. This tangy salad has wonderful
flavor and a beautiful pink color. Remember, we eat with our
eyes, so adding this vibrant pink salad to the menu is a sure
way to avoid boredom. The Ranch Dressing tames the acid
in the pickling juice, but check with your healthcare
provider for clearance on pickled items to ensure they are
safe for the swallow. You do not want the person with
dysphagia to aspirate due to a sudden intake of breath
because of the vinegar.
1 (16-ounce) jar sliced pickled beets,
such as Aunt Nellie’s, drained, with
pickling liquid reserved
½ cup red onion, thinly sliced (optional)
2 tablespoons pickling liquid from the jar
of beets
6 tablespoons Ranch Dressing (see
here), or store-bought
Sea salt and white pepper
For the person with dysphagia:
1. Add the beets, onion, and pickling liquid to a food processor and pulse
until coarsely chopped. Process until you achieve the desired texture.
2. Using a silicone spatula, run the puree through a strainer set over a bowl
to remove any fibers.
3. Stir the Ranch Dressing, salt, and white pepper into the beet puree. Test
as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent, thickened
sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing Methods
(iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
4. Serve, or cover and store in the refrigerator for no more than 48 hours.
(I do not suggest freezing this.)
For non-pureed servings for family members:
Mix the beets and onion in a medium bowl. (Do not add the pickling
liquid.) Add the Ranch Dressing, salt, and pepper, and mix to combine.
Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

person with swallowing difficulties to puree it. To julienne
the vegetables, you can use a knife, a mandoline, a handheld

disc. The Pink Remoulade is excellent as a substitute for
store-bought coleslaw dressing.
1 small jicama, peeled and cut into thin
matchsticks
1 small Granny Smith or Gala apple,
peeled, cored, and cut into thin
matchsticks
1 small Asian pear, peeled, cored, and
cut into thin matchsticks
1 small carrot, peeled and cut into thin
matchsticks
1 cup thinly sliced red cabbage
2 tablespoons Pink Remoulade (see
here)
1. Add the first five ingredients and the dressing to a large mixing bowl
and toss thoroughly to combine. Set aside any servings for family meals
that are not to be pureed, cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve.
2. For the puree, transfer 1 cup slaw to a food processor or high-speed
blender and pulse until the slaw breaks down into a smooth puree.
3. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,

Chunk Chicken Salad
SERVINGS: 2 | IDDSI LEVELS
A delicious and creamy chicken salad that can be made with
leftovers from a rotisserie chicken or Cornish Game Hens
(here), or from scratch with poached chicken breasts.
1 cup cubed cooked chicken (from a
rotisserie chicken*
)
1 stalk celery, peeled and finely diced
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons low-fat sour cream
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or
parsley paste
Sea salt and white pepper
If you are not using a rotisserie chicken, use the following method to poach chicken:
Place 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs in a large saucepan and
cover with water or broth. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to a simmer, and cook until the
chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C), 10 to 15 minutes. If you poach
chicken for this recipe, you can use the poaching liquid in place of water in the puree.
1. In a medium bowl, combine the chicken, celery, mayonnaise, sour
cream, parsley, salt, and white pepper. If reserving a portion for family
meals, set aside, cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve.
2. For the puree, transfer the remaining salad to a blender and add 2
tablespoons water. Pulse until the chicken is broken down. Then
process until you achieve the desired texture, adding more water if
needed for blending.
› Tip: I recommend peeling the celery to remove the strings before
pureeing. It’s an extra step, but it makes for a smoother puree. A
high-speed blender or nutrition extractor will eliminate most of the
celery fibers, but to eliminate any possibility of strings, push the
puree through a mesh strainer to remove them.
3. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
4. If not serving immediately, cover and store in the refrigerator for no
more than 48 hours. (I do not suggest freezing this.)

Chicken Pot Pie
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Chicken pot pie is a favorite American comfort food. This
recipe is simple to prepare because it uses store-bought
cream of chicken soup and store-bought pie crust, and it is
delicious.
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium carrot, cut into ¼-inch rounds
½ cup pearl onions, or ½ yellow onion,
diced
1 packet instant cream of chicken soup
mix
1 pound cooked chicken meat, torn or
chopped into bite-size pieces (from a
rotisserie chicken*
)
½ cup to 1 cup frozen peas
1 Pot Pie Crust (see here)
If you are not using a rotisserie chicken, use the following method to poach chicken.
Place 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs in a large saucepan and
cover with water or broth. Bring to a boil, lower to a simmer, and cook until the chicken
reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C), 10 to 15 minutes.
1. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the
carrot and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about
5 minutes.
2. Add the soup mix to the saucepan along with ½ cup water and stir to
combine. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes. Add the chicken
and peas, stir to combine, and simmer for another 2 minutes. Remove
from the heat.
3. After setting aside any servings for family meals that are not to be
pureed, add one serving to the food processor. Pulse to break up the
chicken, then process until you achieve the desired texture.
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
5. Divide the servings between the dishes or storage containers and using a
squeeze bottle or piping bag with a wide nozzle, pipe Pot Pie Crust
puree onto the filling, in the shape of dots, slices, or swirls. You can
also simply dollop the crust puree onto the filling with a spoon. For
family servings, add a reserved baked crust round.
6. Serve immediately, or allow to cool completely, cover, and refrigerate
for up to 48 hours or freeze for up to 3 months.

Cornish Game Hens with Pan Gravy
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
These little hens have plenty of flavor and present a change
from takeout rotisserie roast chicken that may be high in
sodium. Buy hens that have never been frozen, if they are
available. Otherwise, thaw the frozen hen in the fridge
overnight. You can puree the carrots and onion and serve
them as a side dish with the hens.
2 Cornish game hens
1 yellow onion, cut into wedges
2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch
sections
1 celery stalk, cut into 1-inch sections
1 bay leaf
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
¼ cup white wine (optional)
1 small lemon, halved
2 sprigs rosemary
2 garlic cloves
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
Sea salt and white pepper
2 tablespoons Wondra flour
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400°F (205°C).
Remove and reserve any giblets from inside the hens. In the bottom of a
roasting pan with a rack, arrange the onion, carrots, celery, bay leaf,
and giblets. Add the broth and wine, if using, and top with the rack.
This will be the base of your gravy.
2. Into the cavity of each bird, place ½ lemon, a sprig of rosemary, and a
garlic clove. Rub the outside of the hens with the olive oil, then season
with salt and white pepper.
3. Place the birds on top of the roasting rack, with some room between
them to allow air to circulate. Roast for 20 minutes per pound, until the
juices run clear when a knife is inserted into the joint between the
breast and the thigh, or until a thermometer inserted into the thickest
part of the thigh registers 165°F (75°C).
4. Remove from the oven and transfer the birds to a cutting board or
platter to cool.
5. To make the gravy, remove the rack from the roasting pan. Remove the
vegetables, giblets, and bay leaf from the drippings in the pan. In a
small bowl, combine the Wondra flour with 2 tablespoons water to
make a slurry, and whisk until the mixture is smooth.
6. Place the roasting pan on the stovetop over medium heat and bring the
pan drippings to a simmer. Add the slurry to the pan drippings and
cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil and
thickens. Lower the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove
from the heat.
› Tip: If you like liver, you can add the liver to the gravy puree. You
can discard the bay leaf and then puree the carrot and onions—I
find the celery can become a bit stringy; thicken them to the
prescribed IDDSI level [see here], and serve them as a side dish
with the hens.
7. Once the birds have cooled, carve off the breasts and remove the meat
from the legs and wings. Divide the meat into servings of 4 to 6 ounces
and reserve any servings for family meals, if desired.
8. Place the remaining portions to be pureed in a food processor or
blender. Add ½ cup gravy per serving, and process until you achieve
the desired texture. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a
thickening agent, thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use
IDDSI Testing Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI
level. See here.
9. Serve, or divide into servings for storage or freezing, following the

Chicken Marsala
SERVINGS: 2 | IDDSI LEVELS
This flavorful recipe uses Marsala wine to make a pan sauce
that purees beautifully. Check with your healthcare provider
to make sure there is no conflict between the Marsala wine
and your medications.
1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (8
ounces)
Salt and white pepper
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
8 ounces mushrooms, sliced
¼ cup Marsala wine
¼ cup low-sodium chicken broth
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh
parsley, or ¼ teaspoon dried parsley
2 teaspoons Wondra flour
1. Cut the chicken breast in half horizontally to create two thinner
portions. If the chicken breasts are not of even thickness, place them
between two sheets of plastic wrap and gently pound them with a
kitchen mallet. Season the breasts with a pinch of salt and white pepper.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat.
Add the chicken breasts and sear until lightly golden brown, about 2
minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
3. Warm the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, add the mushrooms, and sauté
until softened and lightly golden in spots, about 3 minutes. Add the
Marsala and the chicken broth and bring the mixture to a simmer.
4. Return the chicken to the pan and simmer, turning the breasts once, until
they are cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add the parsley, stir to
combine, and simmer for 1 more minute.
5. Remove the chicken and mushrooms from the pan, leaving behind the
liquid.
6. In a small bowl, whisk 2 teaspoons Wondra flour with 4 teaspoons
water. Whisk the mixture into the liquid in the pan. Bring to a simmer
and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, about 4
minutes.
7. Remove the pan from the heat. If reserving a portion for family meals,
set aside one of the chicken breast portions, half the mushrooms, and
half the sauce.
8. For the puree, chop the chicken breast into ½-inch pieces. Per serving,
add 1 chicken breast portion, half the mushrooms, and ¼ cup Marsala
sauce to a food processor or blender, and pulse to break up the chicken
and the mushrooms. Process until you achieve the desired texture.
9. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.

Roast Turkey Breast with Lemon and
Herbs
SERVINGS: 8 | IDDSI LEVELS
A turkey breast is more manageable than a whole bird. If
you like dark meat, use the same herbs, but buy a package of
legs. This is a festive centerpiece for a holiday meal. If you
would like to serve the turkey with cranberry sauce, puree
the cranberry sauce to a smooth texture and bind it with
instant thickener (IDDSI Pureed, Level 4 works best for
dipping sauces). I recommend serving this turkey breast with
Mashed Potatoes (see here), as well as other pureed side
vegetables—the more colorful, the better. As long as all the
components of the holiday meal are the same thickness, the
meal is safe for the swallow.
1 (6-pound) turkey breast
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
or rosemary paste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or
parsley paste
3 tablespoons chopped fresh sage or
sage paste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
leaves or thyme paste
Zest of half a lemon
Sea salt and white pepper
1 cup low-sodium turkey or chicken
broth, plus more as needed
½ cup white wine (optional)
Herb Gravy (see here)
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325°F (165°C).
Loosen the skin from the breast to prepare it for the herb paste. In a
food processor, combine 2 tablespoons oil, the herbs, and the lemon
zest. Process into a paste. Use your hands to apply the herb paste under
the skin. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil onto the breast and massage it
into the skin. Season the breast liberally with salt and white pepper.
2. Place the breast on a rack in a roasting pan. Add the broth and wine to
the roasting pan. Place the pan on the center rack and roast for 2 hours
(20 minutes per pound), until the skin is golden brown, and a
thermometer inserted into thickest part of the breast reads 160°F
(70°C). If the skin becomes too brown during roasting, cover it loosely
with aluminum foil.
3. Transfer the breast to a cutting board to rest for 15 minutes.
4. For any family meal servings, slice the turkey breast against the grain
and serve with the gravy. For the puree, cut up the turkey meat (4
ounces per serving) and add it to a food processor or blender. Pulse to
break up the turkey. Add ½ cup gravy per serving and process until you
achieve the desired texture.
5. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
6. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here.

Mom’s Turkey Meatloaf
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Meatloaf is the ultimate American comfort food. It’s a diner
classic, served with a side of Mashed Potatoes (see here) and
Garlic Green Beans (see here). This recipe is for ground
turkey, but it can also be made with ground chicken, ground
beef, or a combination of ground beef and pork.
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
½ onion, finely diced
1 garlic clove, finely chopped, or 1
teaspoon garlic paste
1 pound ground turkey
¼ cup breadcrumbs*
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flatleaf parsley or parsley paste
2 tablespoons parmesan cheese
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce or lowsodium soy sauce
½ teaspoon sea salt
¼ teaspoon white pepper
½ cup ketchup (optional)
Herb Gravy (see here)
Mashed Potatoes (see here)
For those on gluten-free diets, use ½ cup old-fashioned oats in place of the breadcrumbs.
Run the oats through a blender or food processor.
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375°F (190°C).
Warm the olive oil in a medium sauté pan over medium heat. Add the
onion and sauté until translucent, 3 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté 1
minute. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, combine the
cooled onion and garlic with the ground turkey, breadcrumbs, parsley,
parmesan, egg, Worcestershire, salt, and white pepper. Use clean hands
to thoroughly incorporate the mixture, taking care not to overmix or
compact the meat.
3. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking sheet and gently form into a
loaf. Spread the ketchup over the surface. (This is optional, but it
prevents the meatloaf from drying out.)
4. Place the meatloaf in the oven. Cook to an internal temperature of
160°F (70°C). Depending on the heat of your oven and the shape of
your baking pan or loaf pan, begin testing for temperature at 35
minutes. My oven cook time is 50 minutes.
5. Allow to rest for at least 10 minutes. Slice, and set aside any servings
for family meals.
› Tip: For pureeing, use only the glaze on top of the meatloaf, not
the glaze that adheres to the pan, to ensure the safe swallow.
6. For the puree, add two slices (¼ of the loaf) per serving to a food
processor or blender and pulse to break up. Add 2 tablespoons gravy
and ½ cup mashed potatoes per serving and process until you achieve
the desired texture, adding more gravy as needed.
7. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
8. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,

Tempeh, Black Bean, and Veggie
Chili
SERVINGS: 6 | IDDSI LEVELS
This vegetarian chili is so satiating and flavorful, you won’t
miss the meat. Tempeh, a protein source made from organic
soybeans with millet, brown rice, and barley, is a traditional
ingredient in Indonesian and Japanese cuisine. I prefer one
from LightLife. To serve this dish as a family meal, top with
cheddar cheese, sour cream, and sliced scallions.
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
6 ounces tempeh, cut into ½-inch cubes
2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce
1 red onion, finely diced
1 garlic clove, sliced
½ jalapeño pepper, stemmed, seeded,
and finely diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
2 cups kabocha squash, cut into 2-inch
pieces
3 large portobello mushrooms, cut into 2-
inch pieces
2 leeks, white parts only, cleaned and
sliced
1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce
¼ cup tomato paste
1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons red wine (optional)
1 teaspoon chili powder (optional)
1. Warm the oil in a pot over medium heat or in a slow cooker with a sauté
function. Add the tempeh and sauté, stirring occasionally, until lightly
golden. Season with the soy sauce and stir to coat. Transfer the tempeh
to a plate.
2. Add the onion, garlic, jalapeño, bell pepper, kabocha, portobellos, and
leeks to the pot. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly
caramelized, about 10 minutes. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce,
tomato paste, beans, Worcestershire, red wine, and chili powder, if
using.
3. Return the tempeh to the pot and stir. If using a stove, bring to a boil,
lower to a simmer, and cook, covered, with the lid ajar, about 1 hour. If
using a slow cooker, cook on high for 1 hour. Set aside any servings for
family meals.
4. For the puree, blend chili in batches, filling the pitcher only two-thirds
full and venting the lid. Blend until you achieve the desired texture,
transferring each batch to a large bowl.
5. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
6. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,

Asparagus and Mushroom Pot Pie
SERVINGS: 4-6 | IDDSI LEVELS
This vegetarian pot pie is delicious, and it presents an
opportunity to get creative and use up leftover vegetables.
Vary the vegetables in this pot pie according to the tastes of
your household—in place of the asparagus, use leftovers of
grilled, steamed, or roasted vegetables like broccoli,
cauliflower, zucchini, string beans, Brussels sprouts, or
squash. You can use another variety of soup as the base, add
a can of cannellini beans for creaminess and protein, and get
creative with the added cheese, using parmesan, cheddar, or
goat cheese. These variations on vegetarian pot pie are easy,
quick, and infinitely better than anything commercially
packaged.
1 pound asparagus, woody ends
trimmed, peeled if skins are tough,
and cut into bite-sized pieces
1 (12-ounce) can mushroom bisque or
cream of mushroom soup, such as
Amy‘s
¼ cup grated Monterey Jack cheese
1 Pot Pie Crust (see here)
1. Fill a large pot fitted with a steamer basket with 2 inches of water. Bring
the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the asparagus,
cover the pot, and steam until tender, about 4 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, warm the mushroom bisque. Add only
half the amount of water indicated on the can, so the liquid is thick.
Add the cheese and stir until melted and thoroughly combined. Add the
asparagus and stir to combine. Set aside any family servings before
pureeing, adding a reserved baked crust round.
3. For the puree, add the cooled mixture to a food processor or blender.
Pulse to break up the asparagus, then process until you achieve the
desired texture.
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
5. Prepare the Pot Pie Crust puree according to directions (here).
6. Divide the servings between the dishes or storage containers, and using
a squeeze bottle or piping bag with a wide nozzle, pipe Pot Pie Crust
puree onto the filling, in the shape of dots, slices, or swirls. You can
also simply dollop the puree crust onto the filling with a spoon.
7. Serve immediately, or allow to cool completely, cover, and refrigerate
for up to 48 hours or freeze for up to 3 months.

PRO TIPS
To serve a whole pot pie for a family event, such as Game
Day, add all the filling to an 8- or 9-inch baking dish and top
with a store-bought pie crust. Paint the pie crust with an egg
wash (a beaten egg and a tablespoon of water) and bake
according to package instructions, usually forty minutes.
Family and friends cut their own slices. For the loved one,
puree the crust according to the directions for Pot Pie Crust
puree given in the recipe here and puree and thicken the
filling. In the serving dish, add the filling and top with the
crust according to the directions.

Eggplant Parmesan with Ricotta
Topping
SERVINGS: 6 | IDDSI LEVELS
This version of the dish does not require breading and deepfrying. You can add sautéed ground beef or sliced, sautéed
mushrooms to the tomato sauce for heartier variations of this
recipe.
1 medium eggplant, peeled and sliced ⅜
inch thick
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Sea salt and white pepper
2 cups part-skim ricotta*
¼ cup grated parmesan cheese, divided
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon freshly chopped parsley or
parsley paste
1 tablespoon freshly chopped basil or
basil paste
1 (16-ounce) jar pasta sauce, or 2 cups
homemade tomato sauce (see
Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce, here)
Ricotta expands when pureed, so one serving will puree to a larger volume than
unpureed.
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F
(205°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a pastry
brush, paint the slices of eggplant on both sides with oil and place on
the baking sheet in a single layer. Season the slices with salt and white
pepper.
2. Roast until soft and lightly golden, flipping once halfway through
cooking, about 25 minutes. This eliminates the step of frying the
eggplant. It is much less messy and saves time.
3. Meanwhile, in a medium mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, 2
tablespoons parmesan, the eggs, herbs, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ⅛ teaspoon
white pepper. Stir until thoroughly combined and smooth.
4. Lower the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C). Spread 1 cup sauce into
the base of a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Place the cooked eggplant over
the sauce in a single layer, overlapping as needed. Spread another 1 cup
sauce over the top of the eggplant to cover, then top with the ricotta
filling and spread evenly to cover. Sprinkle the surface with the
remaining 2 tablespoons parmesan.
5. Place in the oven and bake for 35 minutes, until browned and bubbling.
Allow to cool, and set aside any family servings before pureeing.
6. For the puree, add the desired number of servings (one-sixth of the
baking dish per serving) to a food processor or blender. Process until
you achieve the desired texture.
7. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
8. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,

Vegetarian Almond Lentil Loaf
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
I created this vegetable loaf as a light version of meatloaf.
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
3 large shallots, diced
1 carrot, peeled and diced
2 garlic cloves, sliced
1 cup red lentils, rinsed
3 cups low-sodium vegetable broth or
water
⅔ cup almond butter loosened with 2
tablespoons warm water and whisked
½ cup minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, or 3
tablespoons parsley paste
1 large egg, lightly beaten
¼ teaspoon sea salt
⅛ teaspoon white pepper
Nonstick cooking spray
Mushroom Gravy (see here)
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a soup pot, warm the oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and
sauté until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the carrot and sauté 3 more
minutes. Add the garlic and sauté 1 more minute.
3. Add the lentils and the broth or water, bring to a boil, and reduce to a
simmer. Place a lid on the pot slightly ajar, and cook until the lentils are
tender, stirring occasionally and skimming any foam that rises to the
surface, about 20 minutes. Transfer the lentil mixture to a large mixing
bowl and allow to cool.
› Tip: To get a good texture for the loaf, use an immersion blender to
puree the lentils before adding the rest of the ingredients.
4. Add the almond butter, parsley, and egg. Season with salt and white
pepper, and stir thoroughly to combine.
5. Grease a loaf pan or silicone muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray.
Transfer the mixture to the loaf pan and use a spatula to smooth the
surface, or scoop ¼-cup portions into the muffin pan.
6. Bake until firm and lightly golden, 30 minutes for the loaf, 20 minutes
for the muffins. Allow to cool, and set aside any family servings before
pureeing.
7. For the puree, place 1 loaf slice or 1 muffin per serving, torn, in a food
processor with ½ cup Mushroom Gravy per portion. Pulse to combine
and process until you achieve the desired texture.
8. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
9. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,

Vegetable Curry
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Vegetables may be mixed and matched according to your
preference. Each combination is unique. I suggest serving
with Rice Congee (see here) on the side.
1 tablespoon grapeseed oil
½ yellow onion, thinly sliced (about ½
cup)
1 garlic clove, finely chopped, or ½
teaspoon garlic paste
1 small carrot, peeled and thinly sliced
(about ½ cup)
½ sweet potato, peeled and cut into ½-
inch dice (about ½ cup)
1 small Yukon Gold potato, peeled and
cut into ½-inch dice (about ½ cup)
½ cup low-sodium vegetable broth
½ red bell pepper, finely diced (about ½
cup)
½ cup cauliflower florets
½ cup frozen peas
½ small zucchini, cut into matchsticks
(about ½ cup)
1 block firm tofu, cut into ½-inch cubes
1 (12- to 16-ounce jar) Panang curry
sauce
Coconut milk, as needed
1. In a large skillet with a lid or a Dutch oven, warm the oil over medium
heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add
the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the carrot and both potatoes.
2. Stir to combine, cover the pan, and cook for 5 minutes. If the vegetables
begin to stick or the pan looks dry, add ¼ cup vegetable broth.
3. Add the red pepper and cauliflower and the remaining ¼ cup vegetable
broth. Cover and cook for 5 more minutes. Check to see if the potatoes
and cauliflower are fork tender. If not, cover and cook for a few more
minutes.
4. Add the peas, zucchini, and tofu. Stir to combine and simmer,
uncovered, for 2 minutes. Add the curry sauce, lower the heat to
medium-low, and cook for 2 minutes, until warmed through. If the
curry sauce is too spicy or strong in flavor, add coconut milk, a few
tablespoons at a time, to make the dish milder.
5. Remove from the heat and allow to cool, and set aside any family
servings before pureeing.
6. For the puree, transfer as many portions as desired to a food processor
or blender. Pulse the dish to incorporate all the elements, venting the lid
to allow heat to escape. Process until you achieve the desired texture.
7. Use thickener as needed to modify texture (for IDDSI Level 5) or
thicken (for IDDSI Level 4). See here.
8. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,

yogurt and 1 tablespoon sweet chutney in small dishes for
flavoring the curry. If the chutney has particles of fruit,
puree it in a food processor with yogurt and run it through a
mesh strainer to remove any solids. Add a pump of thickener
to bind the puree to IDDSI Moderately Thick, Level 3, for
sauces and gravies. The way to eat this is to dip a spoonful
of curry into the dipping sauce.

Cod and Vegetable Parcels
SERVINGS: 2 | IDDSI LEVELS
In the culinary world, this technique is called en papillote,
but I call it the parcel method. Steaming food in parchment
paper is a quick and easy way to prepare individual servings
of fish. See here for more ideas about how to make best use
of the parcel cooking method.
½ cup shaved vegetables, such as
carrots, zucchini, scallions, parsnips,
or asparagus*
8 ounces fresh or frozen cod or any other
white fish, halved
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Sea salt and white pepper
¼ lemon, thinly sliced
You can use any vegetable you like; just make sure they are cut or shaved with a
vegetable peeler thinly enough to be tender after a 10-minute steaming.
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F (175°C), or
fill a large pot fitted with a steamer basket with 2 inches of water and
bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
2. Cut 2 pieces of parchment paper into 12 x 12-inch squares. Place ¼ cup
shaved vegetables on the parchment and lay a 4-ounce fillet of cod over
top. Drizzle each piece of cod with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and season
with salt and white pepper. Top the fish with the lemon slices.
3. Fold and crimp the edges to seal the parchment. (Aluminum foil can be
used as a substitute for parchment paper.)
4. Place the parcels on a baking sheet and place in the oven, or add the
parcels to the steamer basket, cover, and lower the heat to medium-low.
Steam until the fish is cooked through, about 10 minutes.
5. Open the packets carefully and allow the fish to cool slightly. If
reserving a portion for family or friends, serve directly from the parcel.
6. For the puree, remove and discard the lemon. Break up the fish and add
to a food processor or blender, along with the vegetables and the juices
that have accumulated in the parchment packet. Pulse to combine and
process until you achieve the desired texture.
7. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing

Salmon in Puff Pastry
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
This recipe offers a protein, a carb, and a green in one dish
—and it comes together quickly, thanks to store-bought puff
pastry and jarred Alfredo sauce doctored with lemon juice
and a shot of Tabasco. It freezes beautifully. The sauce
makes for an excellent puree. This is a festive dish and may
be served at a holiday or special occasion.
2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice,
divided
Sea salt and white pepper
2 (8-ounce) salmon fillets
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 shallot, thinly sliced
1 garlic clove, thinly sliced
1 bunch spinach, washed and drained, or
½ bag frozen spinach
1 sheet store-bought frozen puff pastry,
thawed
2 cups Rice Congee (see here)
1 large egg, beaten with 1 teaspoon
water (for egg wash)
1 (15-ounce) jar Alfredo sauce
1–2 dashes hot sauce (optional)
1. To a zip-top plastic bag, add the soy sauce, 2 tablespoons lemon juice,
and a pinch of salt and pepper. Add the salmon fillets and turn the bag
several times to coat the fish. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
2. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375°F (190°C).
3. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the
shallot and sauté just until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and
sauté for 1 minute. Add the spinach and cook, stirring, until the spinach
wilts and begins to give off liquid, about 1 more minute. Season lightly
with salt and white pepper and stir to combine. Remove the spinach
mixture from the pan, draining off any liquid.
4. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Lay out the sheet of puff pastry
on the paper. Arrange the Rice Congee down the center, leaving enough
pastry on either side to fold up and enclose the filling.
› Tip: If you’re using previously frozen Rice Congee and the rice
needs hydrating after being defrosted, add it to a pan with several
tablespoons of broth or water. Simmer, stirring, until the rice
absorbs the liquid.
5. Place the drained spinach mixture on top of the Rice Congee. Remove
the salmon from the marinade and arrange the salmon fillets on top of
the spinach. Fold the edges of the puff pastry to enclose the filling.
Squeeze the edges together firmly to seal.
6. Using a sharp knife, make 2 slices in the pastry top to allow steam to
escape. Brush the pastry with the egg wash.
7. Place in the oven and bake until the pastry is golden brown,
approximately 30 minutes. If pastry is browning too quickly after 20
minutes, cover loosely with aluminum foil. To check for doneness, you
can insert a knife into the salmon for a few seconds. The flesh should
feel firm, and the knife should feel warm to the touch. Set aside to cool.
8. Place the Alfredo sauce in a small saucepan over low heat. Add the
remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice and the hot sauce, if using.
9. Remove the pastry from the oven, and divide into 4 servings. Set aside
any portions being served for family meals and serve with the warm
Alfredo sauce.
10. For the puree, break up the pastry and the salmon and add to a food
processor or blender. Add ½ cup sauce per serving. Pulse to break up
the components and process until you achieve the desired texture.
11. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
12. Serve immediately, or allow to cool completely before wrapping tightly
in plastic wrap and then aluminum foil. Packages can be placed in a
zip-top bag for storage. Refrigerate for up to 48 hours or freeze for up
to 1 month. To reheat, follow the directions for Serving, here.

SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Crab cakes are a huge favorite and can be made easily in the
puree kitchen. The dipping sauce is a favorite in my family.
CRAB CAKES
8 ounces jumbo lump crabmeat
¾ cup breadcrumbs (store-bought, or
see sidebar)
½ cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
¼ teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 scallion, finely chopped
½ teaspoon finely chopped fresh chives,
or ¼ teaspoon dried chives
Sea salt and white pepper
TANGY DIPPING SAUCE
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon plain Greek yogurt
1 teaspoon lemon juice
½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425°F (220°C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, combine the crabmeat, breadcrumbs, mayonnaise,
lemon juice, dijon, scallion, and chives, and season with salt and white
pepper.
3. Scoop ¼ cup of the crab mixture and form a patty with your hands,
taking care not to pack the mixture too tightly. Repeat with the
remaining mixture, placing each formed patty on the lined baking sheet.
Let chill in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.
4. Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake until the crab cakes lift
easily off the baking sheet and are lightly browned on the bottoms,
about 10 minutes. Carefully flip and continue to bake until the second
side lifts easily off the pan and is lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes more.
5. Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce. In a small bowl, stir together the
mayonnaise, yogurt, lemon juice, and Dijon. Thicken to Moderately
Thick, Level 3, for sauces and gravies. This sauce may be served on the
side for dipping or added to the puree.
6. Set aside any servings for family meals, and serve with the dipping
sauce alongside.
7. For the puree, break 1 crab cake per serving into a food processor or
blender. Add 3 tablespoons water or broth and 2 teaspoons dipping
sauce per serving. Pulse to break up the crab cake and then process
until you achieve the desired texture.
8. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
9. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here. (I freeze this for up to 1
month, not 3 months.)

Fresh Breadcrumbs
To make fresh breadcrumbs, which are far more moist than
packaged breadcrumbs, cut or tear slices of bread into ½-inch pieces
and put them in a food processor. Pulse until the bread reaches the
desired crumb texture. I learned this method from Jacques Pépin.

Shrimp, Cheese, and Spinach–Stuffed
Portobellos
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Because of the inclusion of shellfish, this is a festive dish
and is great for a holiday or a special occasion. You can use
scallops, sautéed in a pan with olive oil, or warmed lump
crabmeat in place of the shrimp.
4 portobello mushroom caps (each about
3 inches in diameter)
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil,
divided
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
White pepper
2 shallots, or ½ yellow onion, thinly sliced
1½ cups spinach leaves, coarsely
chopped
½ cup ricotta or mascarpone cheese
¼ cup grated parmesan
1 large egg
Sea salt
16 cooked medium shrimp (about 8
ounces), peeled, deveined, tails
removed
Dried parsley, for serving
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400°F (205°C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the soy sauce,
and a pinch of white pepper. Transfer the mushrooms to the baking
sheet and, using a pastry brush, paint the caps on both sides with the
marinade. Set aside.
3. Warm the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium
heat. Add the shallots and sauté until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add
the spinach and stir just until it wilts.
4. Transfer the shallots and spinach to a large mixing bowl to cool slightly.
Add the ricotta, parmesan, egg, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir until
thoroughly combined.
5. Add about 2 tablespoons filling to each of the prepared mushroom caps.
Transfer to the oven and bake until the mushrooms are fork tender and
the filling is lightly golden, 12 to 15 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, warm the cooked shrimp in the oven or a skillet over low
heat. For family meal portions, top each mushroom cap with 4 shrimp
and sprinkle with dried parsley, and set aside.
7. For the puree, cut a baked mushroom cap into quarters and transfer to a
food processor or blender, along with 4 shrimp per serving and any
juices that have accumulated on the sheet pan. Pulse to break up the
shrimp and mushrooms and process until you achieve the desired
texture.
8. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
9. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here. (I freeze this for up to 1
month, not 3 months.)

Shrimp and Vegetable Stir-Fry
SERVINGS: 2 | IDDSI LEVELS
You can prepare this recipe with cooked frozen shrimp. Just
thaw the shrimp in a bowl of water in the refrigerator, drain,
and pat dry. For other variations, you can use leftover
cooked chicken or frozen scallops. This stir-fry can also be
made vegetarian or vegan with 4 ounces of diced silken tofu
and a selection of vegetables such as onions, mushrooms,
broccoli, and cabbage. Serve with a side dish of 4 ounces of
Rice Congee, here.
1 pound shrimp, peeled, with tails left on,
and deveined
2 tablespoons grapeseed oil, divided
1 garlic clove, finely chopped or grated,
or 1 teaspoon garlic paste
1-inch piece ginger, peeled and finely
chopped or grated, or 1 tablespoon
ginger paste
2 scallions, thinly sliced
1 medium zucchini, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce (I like Soy
Vay brand because it is readily
available in supermarkets and is
made without stabilizers, gums, or
artificial ingredients)
1. I like to cook the shrimp with tails on for flavor and remove the tails for
the puree. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or a large skillet over medium
heat. Add the garlic, ginger, and scallions. Stir-fry, stirring frequently,
until fragrant, 2 minutes.
2. Add the shrimp and cook until the shrimp all turn pink, 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove the shrimp mixture from the pan, cover with aluminum foil to
keep warm, and set aside.
3. Add the zucchini to the skillet and stir-fry for 2 minutes, until they start
to turn lightly golden. Add 3 tablespoons water to the skillet, cover the
pan, and steam the zucchini until soft, about 4 minutes. Add more water
if needed to keep things from sticking or burning.
4. Return the shrimp to the pan along with 2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce
and stir until well combined. Remove the pan from the heat and allow
the contents to cool. Set aside a 1-cup family serving before pureeing.
5. For the puree, add the stir-fry (remember to remove the tails from the
shrimp) to a food processor or blender. Pulse several times to break up
the veggies and the shrimp, and then process until you achieve the
desired texture, adding 1 tablespoon water and scraping down the sides
of the bowl as needed.
6. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
7. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here. (I freeze this for up to 1
month, not 3 months.)

Shepherd’s Pie
SERVINGS: 2 | IDDSI LEVELS
The great chef Jacques Pépin is forever praising the use of
leftovers to make a second dish. This recipe follows the
principle of using everything in the kitchen and wasting
nothing. If you have leftover lamb or beef stew, use it to
make this quick and simple Shepherd’s Pie.
1 cup Beef Stew (or Lamb and Sweet
Potato variation)
1 cup Mashed Potatoes (see here)
1 tablespoon butter or non-trans-fat
margarine (often called a tub spread)
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F (175°C).
Place the stew in a small baking dish. Top with the mashed potatoes
and spread to cover the stew. Dot the mashed potatoes with butter or
margarine. Bake until the potatoes are lightly browned on top, about 15
minutes. Set aside any servings for family meals that are not to be
pureed.
2. For the puree, once the pie has cooled, put the desired number of
portions into a food processor or blender. Pulse a few times to break up
the meat and vegetables. Process until you achieve the desired texture.
If the dish is too thick, add a splash of gravy, broth, or water.
3. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
4. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here.

PRO TIPS
For an even easier shepherd’s pie for the busy cook, I highly
recommend using Bob’s Red Mill Instant Mashed Potatoes.
It tastes like the real thing. Make the mashed potatoes
according to directions on the package for two cups of
mashed potatoes. My mother’s secret ingredient was two
teaspoons of good mayonnaise for two cups of mashed
potatoes.

Beef Stew
SERVINGS: 6 | IDDSI LEVELS
Keep in mind when browning the meat in this and the
following recipes to sear the meat lightly, as a heavy sear is
not safe for the swallow. This can also be made in a slow
cooker set on low for 4 hours. About potatoes: you may add
1 pound of cubed Yukon Gold potatoes to the stew. If you
plan to use this dish as the basis for the Shepherd’s Pie, here,
leave out the potatoes.
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 pounds beef chuck, trimmed of excess
fat and membrane, cut into 1½-inch
cubes
1 teaspoon sea salt
½ teaspoon white pepper
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
2 medium carrots, halved lengthwise and
cut into ½-inch half moons
1 garlic clove, finely chopped, or 1
teaspoon garlic paste
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
2 medium Yukon Gold potatoes, cubed
(optional)
1 quart low-sodium beef or chicken stock
¼ cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 cup frozen peas
1. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or large saucepan over medium-high heat.
Season the beef with salt and pepper. In batches, add the beef to the pot
and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned on all sides, about
6 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
2. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion and cook, stirring
occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the carrots and
cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook just until fragrant, about
1 minute.
3. Move the vegetables off to one side, and add the tomato paste to the
empty side of the pot and let cook without stirring until the edges
brown, about 2 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons water and the soy sauce and
stir to dissolve the tomato paste, then mix with the vegetables.
4. Return the beef and any juices to the pot. Add the stock (and potatoes if
desired) and stir to combine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Reduce the heat to medium- low and cover tightly. Simmer until the
beef is tender, about 2 hours.
5. Whisk the flour and ¼ cup water in a small bowl to make a smooth
slurry. Whisk in enough of the slurry into the simmering stew to get the
gravy consistency of IDDSI Moderately Thick, Level 3, sauces and
gravies.
6. Stir in the peas and simmer for 5 minutes. Season with additional salt
and pepper. Let cool completely. Reserve portions for family meals (or
to make Shepherd’s Pie, see here).
7. For the puree, transfer portions of the stew to a food processor or
blender (filling the pitcher only two-thirds full and venting the lid).
Pulse to break up the stew, then process until you achieve the desired
texture. Transfer to a bowl and repeat until all the stew is pureed.
8. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
9. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here.

Cooking Garlic
Be careful when cooking garlic. If it burns, the entire dish will taste
bitter. I always add it at the end of sautéing the onions and other
vegetables, and then only cook it for a minute, just enough for it to
soften and smell fragrant. When it reaches that point, stir in some
liquid to stop it from browning further.
Variations
• For Lamb and Sweet Potato Stew, substitute boneless lamb shoulder
for the beef. Substitute sweet potatoes for the Yukon Gold potatoes.
• For Veal and Rosemary Stew, substitute boneless veal shoulder for the
beef. Add 1 large sprig of rosemary with the stock. After cooking,
remove the rosemary stem, then serve.

Pot Roast
SERVINGS: 6 | IDDSI LEVELS
This can be made in a Dutch oven or any heavy pot with a
cover, or a slow cooker set on low for 4 hours. It is delicious
served with Mashed Potatoes (see here) or a side of whole
grains (see here).
2½-pound beef chuck roast, trimmed of
excess fat and membrane, tied with
kitchen twine
Sea salt and white pepper
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 medium yellow onions, chopped
2 large carrots, cut into ½-inch pieces
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 (15-ounce) can tomato puree
½ teaspoon dried thyme or thyme paste
1 bay leaf
⅛ teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce
1 quart low-sodium beef or chicken stock
1 tablespoon unbleached all-purpose
flour
1. Place an oven rack low enough to fit the Dutch oven with a lid and
preheat to 350°F (175°C).
2. Liberally season the beef on all sides with salt and white pepper. In a
large pot or Dutch oven, warm the oil over medium-high heat. Sear the
beef lightly on all sides. (A heavy sear is not safe for the swallow.)
Transfer the seared beef to a plate.
3. Add the onions to the pot and sauté until translucent, 3 minutes. Add the
carrots and sauté for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute.
Add the tomato puree, thyme, bay leaf, and soy sauce. Stir to combine,
and bring the mixture to a simmer for 1 minute.
4. If using a slow cooker, transfer the ingredients in the pot to the slow
cooker, add the stock and the beef, and cook on low for 4 hours.
5. If using a Dutch oven, add the stock and return the beef to the pot.
Cover the pot and transfer to the oven. Cook for 1 hour. Reduce the
oven temperature to 325°F (165°C) and simmer for 1½ more hours.
6. When done, uncover the pot roast and allow to cool. Transfer the beef to
a cutting board. Remove the twine.
7. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Transfer the braising liquid and
vegetables to a blender, vent the lid to allow steam to escape, and puree
until smooth. Return the puree to the pot, or transfer to a saucepan.
8. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon flour with 2 tablespoons of
the puree to make a slurry. Add the slurry to the puree in the pot, whisk
to combine, and set over medium heat. Bring to a boil, lower to a
simmer, and cook for 3 minutes, until the puree thickens into a sauce.
9. Set aside servings for family meals, with slices of pot roast topped with
a ladleful of sauce and vegetables.
10. For the puree, cut the pot roast into 1-inch pieces and transfer to a food
processor or blender. Add ½ cup sauce per serving. Pulse a few times to
break down the meat. Process until you achieve the desired texture.
11. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
12. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,

Mild Steak Chili
SERVINGS: 6 | IDDSI LEVELS
The heat in this chili is very mild but remember to get
clearance from a healthcare provider before eating or
serving spicy foods. For a heat-free version, simply
eliminate the chili powder, Tabasco, and cayenne.
1 pound ribeye or sirloin steak, trimmed
of excess fat, cut into 1-inch cubes
Sea salt and white pepper
2 tablespoons grapeseed oil
1 medium yellow onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 teaspoon chili powder (optional)
½ teaspoon cumin
½ teaspoon cayenne powder (optional)
2 dashes Tabasco (optional)
1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (15-ounce) can low-sodium kidney
beans, rinsed and drained
Optional toppings: cheddar cheese,
sour cream, thinly sliced scallion
1. Season the steak cubes with salt and white pepper. In a large pot or
Dutch oven, warm the oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches
if needed, lightly brown the steak on all sides. Transfer the meat to a
plate and set aside.
2. Lower the heat to medium. Add the onion and sauté until translucent, 3
minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste,
chili powder, cumin, cayenne, and Tabasco. Stir to coat the aromatics in
the tomato paste and sauté to toast the spices, 2 minutes.
3. Return the meat to the pot, along with any juices that have accumulated
on the plate. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and beans. Stir to
combine, and bring the mixture to a boil.
4. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 1 hour, adding a splash of
water if the chili becomes too thick. Remove from the heat and allow to
cool. Set aside any servings for family meals.
5. For the puree, transfer portions of the chili to a food processor or
blender (only fill it two-thirds full and vent the lid). Add optional
toppings to the blender, if desired. Pulse to break up the meat, then
process until you achieve the desired texture. Transfer to a bowl and
repeat until all the chili is pureed.
6. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing

Classic Roast Loin of Pork
SERVINGS: UP TO 8 | IDDSI LEVELS
This simple method for roasting pork will yield several other
delicious dishes. Here it is served with a rich and flavorful
Mushroom Gravy. The gravy is important because it is what
flavors the puree.
2 pounds pork loin
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons grapeseed oil, divided
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
Sea salt and white pepper
Mushroom Gravy (see here)
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F (175°C).
Make small slits in the surface of the pork and insert the slices of garlic.
Coat the bottom of a shallow baking dish with 1 tablespoon oil. Add the
pork to the pan. Rub the pork with the remaining oil and the soy sauce,
and season with salt and white pepper.
2. Roast until a thermometer inserted into the center of the loin reads
145°F (65°C), about 1 hour. Transfer the meat to a cutting board and
allow to rest for at least 10 minutes.
3. Divide the pork into 4-ounce portions and set aside any pork that will be
used to make other dishes. Set aside any servings for family meals. To
serve, slice the pork and serve with warm Mushroom Gravy spooned
over the top.
4. For the puree, cut the pork into 1-inch pieces and place in a food
processor or blender. Pulse a few times to break up the pork. Add ½ cup
Mushroom Gravy and process until you achieve the desired texture. If
needed, add a few tablespoons of broth or water to create a good
consistency.
5. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickener is needed; use
IDDSI Testing Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI
level. See here.
6. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,

PRO TIPS
The Classic Roast Loin of Pork (see here) is perfect for the
Batch Cooking Method (see here). Once you cook it, you
can make several meals out of it. In addition to serving it
with Mushroom Gravy (see here), you can use it to make
Barbecued Pork Loin (see here), Pork Fried Rice (see here),
and Wonton Soup (see here).
This is the beauty of batch cooking—a quick meal is always
on hand. Depending on your schedule, you can freeze the
cooked pork until you are ready to make the variations.
Mushroom Gravy
YIELD: 1½ CUPS | IDDSI LEVEL
This beats anything you can buy packaged off the
shelf or in the freezer section. Most store-bought
gravies are high in sodium and contain preservatives
and fillers. This homemade gravy is fresher, of higher
quality, and cheaper—not to mention it tastes
delicious. The baby Bella mushrooms, also called
cremini, have more flavor than white button
mushrooms, but you can use whatever mushrooms are
in season. I use Wondra flour for thickening because it
is light and has less tendency to form lumps. Double
the recipe if you want to have extra gravy on hand for
a social gathering or in the freezer.
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 pound baby Bella or cremini
mushrooms, sliced
1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth
2 tablespoons Wondra flour
1 teaspoon fresh thyme, or ½
teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce
Sea salt and white pepper
1. Warm 2 tablespoons oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high
heat. Add the mushrooms and sauté, stirring occasionally and
adding a little more oil if needed, until the mushrooms have
softened and are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer the
mushrooms to a bowl and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, bring the broth to a simmer in a small saucepan.
Add the remaining oil to the sauté pan. Add the Wondra flour to
the oil and cook, stirring constantly, until just starting to turn
lightly golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly add the simmering
broth, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.
3. Add the mushrooms, thyme, and soy sauce along with any juices
that have accumulated in the bowl, and stir to combine. Simmer
for 6 minutes, until thickened. Remove from the heat. Set aside
some gravy for family meals, if desired.
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI
Testing Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI
level. See here.
5. Serve immediately or divide into ½ cup servings for storage or
freezing, following the directions for Serving, here.

Barbecued Pork Loin
SERVINGS: 1 | IDDSI LEVELS
This dish combines 4 ounces of Classic Roast Loin of Pork
with store-bought or homemade barbecue sauce. While I
prefer my homemade sauce, I think it is better to have a
modified version of the dish than not to have the dish at all.
When purchasing barbecue sauce, it is important to read
labels for sugar content and degree of mildness. Check with
your healthcare provider about eating or serving spicy
food.
4 ounces Classic Roast Loin of Pork (see
here), cut into 1-inch cubes, warmed
¼ cup low-sodium chicken broth,
warmed
¼ cup Barbecue Sauce, homemade (see
here) or store-bought
1. Add the pork, broth, and Barbecue Sauce to a food processor or blender.
Pulse to break up the pork, and then process until you achieve the
desired texture. Adjust the puree with sauce or broth as needed for a
good consistency.
2. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened broth is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
› Tip: For the puree, I use broth along with the barbecue sauce to get
a dish that tastes good but does not contain too much sugar, sodium,
or heat. For a family meal serving, warm a thinly sliced 4-ounce
portion of the pork loin with the barbecue sauce.
3. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here.

Barbecue Sauce
YIELD: 1½ CUPS | IDDSI LEVEL
This quickie homemade barbecue sauce was inspired
by chef Bobby Flay. I’ve adapted it for the puree
kitchen. It’s easy to prepare, it’s made from pantry
items, and hoisin sauce is its secret ingredient. Hoisin
sauce can be found in most supermarkets and in Asian
markets. It is made from plums and imparts a rich,
deep flavor to the sauce. This sauce is customizable
and can be adjusted according to individual taste.
1 cup ketchup
½ cup molasses
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce
1. In a small saucepan, combine the ketchup, molasses, Dijon,
hoisin sauce, honey, and soy sauce. Stir to combine, set over
medium-low heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Allow to cool. Set
aside a portion for family servings before pureeing.
2. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI
Testing Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI
level. See here.
3. Use immediately, or store in an airtight container in the
refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, or the freezer for up to 3 months.

using chicken, shrimp, scallops, or any other leftover protein
in place of the pork.
1 tablespoon grapeseed oil
3 scallions, white and green parts, thinly
sliced
1 medium carrot, halved lengthwise and
sliced into thin half moons
1 garlic clove, finely chopped, or 1
teaspoon garlic paste
4 ounces Classic Roast Loin of Pork (see
here), cut into ½-inch dice
2 cups cooked rice (see here)
¼ cup low-sodium broth
2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
½ cup frozen peas
1 large egg
1. In a large skillet or a wok, warm the oil over medium heat. Add the
scallions and sauté until translucent, 1 minute. Add the carrot slices and
2 tablespoons water and cook until the carrot slices are softened, 2
minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute.
2. Stir in the cubed pork and the cooked rice, and stir-fry with the
vegetables, giving the rice a chance to pick up flavor and be coated
with oil, 2 minutes. Add the broth, soy sauce, and peas, and continue to
cook, stirring, until the flavors have melded, about 2 more minutes.
3. In a separate pan, scramble an egg. Stir the scrambled egg into the rice.
Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Set aside any servings for
family meals.
4. For the puree, add as many servings as you need to puree to a food
processor. Pulse to break down the elements of the dish. Process until
you achieve the desired texture, adding a tablespoon or so of broth as
needed.
5. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
6. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,

Garlic and Rosemary Lamb Chops
SERVINGS: 2 | IDDSI LEVELS
This is a surprisingly easy and delicious puree. Use an
indoor grill on medium heat, or pan-sauté on low, to cook
the chops to the desired degree of doneness, low and slow,
without charring. Test by using an instant-read thermometer
or making a cut and taking a look. Serve with Mashed
Potatoes (see here) or Minty Pureed Peas (see here).
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped or grated,
or 2 teaspoons garlic paste
1 sprig rosemary, chopped
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
Sea salt and white pepper
4 lamb rib chops, approximately 1½
pounds
Low-sodium stock or leftover Mushroom
Gravy (see here), as needed
1. In a small bowl, combine the garlic, rosemary, olive oil, salt, and
pepper. Rub onto the lamb chops and allow to marinate at room
temperature for 15 minutes.
2. Preheat a grill to medium-high, or set a grill pan on the stove over
medium-high heat. Grill the lamb chops to the desired doneness, 3 to 5
minutes per side. For medium-rare, an instant-read thermometer
inserted into the center of a lamb chop should read 135°F (55°C).
Remove from the grill and set aside to rest for 10 minutes. Set aside
any family serving before pureeing.
3. For the puree, remove the meat from the bones, chop the lamb into 1-
inch pieces, and transfer to a food processor or high-speed blender.
Pulse to break up the meat. Add about ¼ cup stock per serving. (If you
have leftover Mushroom Gravy [see here] in the freezer, you can also
use that for the puree liquid.) Process until you achieve the desired
texture, adding more liquid as needed.
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if thickening is needed; use
IDDSI Testing Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI

Holiday Ham
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Most holiday hams come in sizes around 10 pounds, so if
you only need a few servings, I have been advised by my
butcher that the best smaller holiday ham, around 5 pounds,
is a bone-in smoked ham. This is precooked. Heat it
according to directions for the weight of the ham. This is
great with a serving of Braised Greens (see here) or Garlic
Green Beans (see here) as the side dish.
5-pound bone-in smoked ham
1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth
Slow-Baked Sweet Potatoes with
Orange, mashed (see here)
Pineapple Honey Mustard Glaze (see
here)
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 200°F (95°C).
Place the ham on a sheet pan, cover with foil, and place in the oven
until warmed through, about 1 hour.
2. Remove from the oven, transfer to a cutting board, and carve portions of
the meat from the bone. Set aside any servings for family meals and
tent with foil to keep warm.
3. Serve with ½ cup Slow-Baked Sweet Potatoes with Orange and 2
tablespoons Pineapple Honey Mustard Glaze per serving, for family
and pureed servings.
4. For the puree, place as many 4-ounce portions of the ham as desired, cut
into 1-inch pieces, into a food processor or blender. Pulse to break up
the ham. Add ¼ cup broth per serving, and process until you achieve
the desired texture, adding more broth as needed. Add ½ cup SlowBaked Sweet Potatoes per serving and pulse several times to combine.
5. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if thickening is needed; use

Pineapple Honey Mustard Glaze
YIELD: 1½ CUPS | IDDSI LEVEL
There are a number of store-bought glazes available,
especially around the holidays. My kitchen tests
revealed that the commercial brands were often too
heavy on the spices for people with swallowing
difficulties. They also contained preservatives and
chemicals. As chef Wolfgang Puck says, “When you
make it yourself, you know what’s in it.” Here is a
simple recipe for a homemade glaze.
1 cup canned pineapple
1 tablespoon canned pineapple juice
4 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
Pinch of ground cinnamon
Pinch of ground cloves
1. In a blender, combine the pineapple and its juices, honey, Dijon,
and spices. Puree until smooth. Transfer to a small saucepan and
warm over medium-low heat for 2 minutes. Set aside a portion
for family meals, if desired.
2. Transfer the glaze to a small ramekin. Allow to cool. Test as you
go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent, thickened
sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing Methods
(iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
3. Use immediately, or store in an airtight container in the
refrigerator for up to 1 week or freeze for one month.

Stuffed Cabbage
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
This may seem like an old-fashioned dish, but think of it as a
warm wrap of vegetables, carbs, and protein baked with a
sauce for puree. It is an ideal dish for the dysphagia kitchen,
especially since it offers variety. The classic wrap is
cabbage, but kale or chard leaves can be used as well. The
protein here is ground beef, but you can use ground pork,
chicken, turkey, or silken tofu. The sauce is tomato, but it
could instead be gravy or a cream sauce. Any of the grains
listed in the Whole Grains (see here) section may be used in
place of the Rice Congee. This is a warm and comforting
dish and offers variety.
8 leaves green or Napa cabbage,
washed and dried, with hard center
stalk removed
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
½ medium yellow onion, diced
1 garlic clove, finely chopped, or 1
teaspoon garlic paste
1 pound ground beef
Sea salt and white pepper
2½ cups Rice Congee (see here)
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh
parsley or parsley paste
1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce
Bay leaf, optional (if using, make sure to
remove after the dish is cooked)
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F (175°C).
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the cabbage leaves and parboil
until they are tender and pliable, 3 minutes. Drain well and set aside to
cool and dry.
2. Warm the oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onion and
sauté until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1
more minute. Add the beef, season with salt and white pepper, and
cook, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Add
the Rice Congee and parsley and stir to combine well. Remove from
the heat and allow to cool.
3. Place a cabbage leaf in the center of a clean cutting board. Place 3 to 4
tablespoons of the filling in the center. Bring the edge of the cabbage
leaf that is closest to you over the filling, then tuck the two sides over
the filling, and roll the leaf away from you to envelop the filling
completely (You can use a sushi mat for this, to help form the roll. You
can also use a toothpick to seal the roll closed.)
4. Line up the completed cabbage rolls in a 9 x 9-inch baking dish. Cover
with the tomato sauce and tuck a bay leaf into the sauce. Cover the dish
tightly with foil and bake for 1 hour. Remove from the oven, uncover,
and allow to cool. Remove the bay leaf and set aside any servings for
family meals before pureeing.
5. For the puree, place as many cabbage rolls as you like into a food
processor or blender. Pulse to break up the components. Add ½ cup of
sauce and process until you achieve the desired texture. Check to make
sure that the cabbage puree has no thick stems or fibers. If necessary,
pass it through a mesh strainer using a silicone spatula.
6. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.

Sausage and Rice–Stuffed Peppers
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
By precooking the bell peppers, you shorten the cooking
time of the whole dish, deepen the peppers’ flavor, and yield
a softer texture for the puree. The traditional presentation for
stuffed peppers is to cut off the top and bake standing up.
This is difficult for puree, so I have adopted the lengthwise
cut. For variety, use different grains or vary the protein,
using another ground meat or tofu in place of the sausage.
2 medium red bell peppers, sliced
vertically into halves, stems and
seeds removed
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus
more for drizzling
4 ounces sweet Italian sausage, casing
removed
1 shallot, thinly sliced
1 garlic clove, thinly sliced
2 cups Rice Congee (see here), or
substitute quinoa, millet, barley, or
buckwheat (see Whole Grains, here)
½ teaspoon dried parsley
1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400°F (205°C).
Paint the pepper halves with olive oil, place on a baking sheet cut side
down, and roast until softened, about 20 minutes. Set aside to cool.
2. Meanwhile, warm 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over
medium heat. Add the sausage and cook, using a wooden spoon to
break the meat into small pieces, until no longer pink and very lightly
browned, about 5 minutes.
3. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the meat to a large bowl. Add the shallot
to the pan and sauté, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 2 minutes.
Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.
4. Transfer the shallot and garlic to the bowl with the sausage meat. Add
the Rice Congee and dried parsley to the bowl and stir to combine.
5. Lower the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C). Add the diced tomatoes
and tomato sauce to a 9 x 9-inch baking dish and stir to combine.
6. Fill each pepper half with about ¾ cup of filling and carefully transfer
them to the baking dish, filling side up. Cover the dish with aluminum
foil and bake for 30 minutes. Allow to cool, and set aside any servings
for family meals before pureeing.
7. For the puree, place as many pepper halves as you like into a food
processor or blender. Pulse to break up the components. Add ½ cup of
sauce and process until you achieve the desired texture. Check to make
sure that the peppers have pureed smoothly. If necessary, pass through a
mesh strainer using a silicone spatula.
8. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.

Sausage and Peppers
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
This dish is inspired by a classic flavor profile and a timehonored favorite of Italian street food. This version, adapted
for home use, is also versatile, because you can use the
gravy with other proteins such as a chicken breast, a small
steak, a burger, or even eggs for a sausage, onion, and
peppers omelet.
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings
removed
Onion and Pepper Smother Gravy (see
here)
1. Warm the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and
cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through and lightly golden, 6
to 7 minutes. Set aside to cool.
2. For family meals, set aside a portion and serve the warm sausage topped
with the gravy. (For a more classic presentation for family meals, you
can leave the sausage in the casing and sear it in the skillet until golden
and blistered on all sides and cooked through. Serve on a plate or a roll,
smothered with the gravy.)
3. For the puree, add 4 ounces sausage and ½ cup Onion and Pepper
Smother Gravy per serving to a food processor or blender with the lid
vented. Pulse to break up the ingredients and process until you achieve
the desired texture.
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing

Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce
SERVINGS: 2 (PLUS ABOUT 2 QUARTS LEFTOVER SAUCE) | IDDSI LEVELS
In the world of Italian cooks, everyone has a favorite sauce.
My mother always added a can of tomato paste, thinned out
with several tablespoons of water whisked in. This adds
thickness to the sauce and gives it a depth of flavor. I like to
make a pot of sauce once a month; that way a good sauce is
always on hand for a quick meal. This sauce freezes
particularly well.
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 large yellow onion, diced
1 medium carrot, diced
1 medium celery stalk, diced
1 teaspoon oregano paste
1 teaspoon parsley paste
1 teaspoon basil paste
3 garlic cloves, sliced or diced
1 (4-ounce) can tomato paste
¼ cup red wine (optional)
1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (28-ounce) can tomato puree
1 (28-ounce) can tomato sauce
Sea salt
8 ounces spaghetti
1. In a large stockpot, warm the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion,
carrot, celery, and the herb pastes and sauté, stirring occasionally, until
softened, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute.
2. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until the raw taste of the tomato
paste cooks off and it begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add the red
wine and bring to a simmer, stirring to scrape up any tomato paste from
the bottom of the pot.

with your pasta.
› Tip: Transfer the rest of the sauce to storage containers. This sauce
will keep in the refrigerator for up to 48 hours and in the freezer for
up to 3 months.
4. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season the water
generously with salt, add the spaghetti, and cook for 1 minute longer
than the package instructions indicate. Drain and set aside any family
servings before pureeing.
5. For the puree, add the spaghetti to a food processor or blender, along
with ½ cup sauce per serving. Pulse to break down the pasta and

Lasagna
SERVINGS: 6 | IDDSI LEVELS
This lasagna purees and freezes beautifully. Aside from the
convenience, no-boil lasagna noodles are thinner, which
makes for a better proportion of carbohydrate to protein and
vegetable. The oven-ready noodles also make for a better
puree because they are less starchy. This recipe eliminates
the traditional mozzarella cheese, which can cause
swallowing difficulties.
3 cups ricotta cheese
½ cup grated parmesan, plus more for
topping
2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf
parsley or parsley paste
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
Sea salt and white pepper
1 quart tomato sauce (from Spaghetti
with Tomato Sauce, see here), or 1
(32-ounce) jar marinara sauce
1 (9-ounce) package oven-ready lasagna
noodles
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F (175°C). In a
bowl, mix the ricotta, parmesan, parsley, eggs, and a pinch of salt and
white pepper until smooth.
2. Spread 1¼ cups sauce in the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Add a
layer of four noodles, overlapping by ¼ inch to create a solid base.
Spread ½ cup sauce over the bottom layer of noodles to make sure the
noodles have enough sauce to cook properly.
3. Spread 1 cup of the ricotta filling over the sauce, then add a second
layer of noodles and cover with ½ cup sauce. Spread another cup of the
ricotta filling over the sauce, followed by a third layer of noodles and ½
cup sauce.
4. Finally, spread the last cup of the ricotta filling followed by the final
layer of noodles. This uses twelve noodles in all. Spread the remaining
1¼ cups sauce over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle the top with
parmesan cheese.
5. Bake until browned and bubbly, 50 minutes. Remove from the oven,
setting aside any servings for family meals, and let cool before
pureeing.
6. For the puree, transfer the desired number of servings to a food
processor and pulse to break up the elements. Process until you achieve
the desired texture. Add sauce if needed to prevent stickiness.
7. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.

Turkey Meatballs and Spaghetti
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
This recipe employs the technique of oven-roasting the
meatballs. This eliminates the step of browning meatballs in
a pan of oil, which allows you to use less oil and makes for
easier cleanup. Meatballs and spaghetti are a delicious
classic for the family as well as for a puree. For freezer
storage, make a double batch.
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil,
divided
1 pound ground turkey
1 large egg
2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf
parsley or parsley paste
1 garlic clove, grated, or 1 teaspoon
garlic paste
¼ cup Italian-style seasoned
breadcrumbs, plus more as needed
Sea salt and white pepper
1 quart tomato sauce (from Spaghetti
with Tomato Sauce, see here), or 1
(32-ounce) jar marinara sauce
8 ounces spaghetti
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425°F (220°C).
Lightly oil a half baking sheet, or use a silicone cupcake sheet placed
on a baking sheet.
2. Add the ground turkey to a large mixing bowl along with the egg,
parmesan, parsley, garlic, breadcrumbs, 1 teaspoon oil, and a pinch of
sea salt and white pepper. Using clean wet hands, mix gently to
thoroughly incorporate the mixture.
3. If the mixture is too wet to form meatballs, add addi- tional
breadcrumbs, 2 teaspoons at a time. Mix thoroughly, taking care not to
overwork the mixture so that the meatballs will not be tough. Cover the
bowl and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
4. Using a small cookie scoop, or a tablespoon and your hands (taking care
not to pack the mixture tightly), form 1-inch meatballs and transfer
them to the baking sheet or to the silicone cupcake sheet.
5. Add the remaining olive oil to a small bowl and, using a pastry brush,
paint each meatball with the olive oil. Roast for 15 minutes, turning the
meatballs halfway through roasting, until they are light golden brown.
› Tip: You can freeze extra meatballs with sauce in freezer- and ovensafe glass storage containers.
6. Meanwhile, place the sauce in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer
over medium-low heat. Transfer the roasted meatballs to the simmering
sauce and cook for 20 minutes.
7. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season the water generously with
salt, add the spaghetti, and cook for 1 minute longer than the package
instructions indicate. Drain the spaghetti and set aside any family
servings before pureeing, and serve topped with meatballs and sauce.
8. For the puree, break up 3 meatballs per serving into a food processor or
high-speed blender. Add ½ cup sauce and about 1 cup cooked spaghetti
per serving. Pulse to break down the meatballs and pasta and process
until you achieve the desired texture.
9. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
10. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here.

Linguine with Clam Sauce
SERVINGS: 2 | IDDSI LEVELS
A delicious dish, both for anyone with swallowing
difficulties and for family and friends. This recipe may be
doubled for a group or to stock the freezer. For service, the
pureed and thickened pasta may be piped onto a plate to
resemble spaghetti. The clam sauce is made separately,
pureed and thickened, and added over the top of the dish of
piped spaghetti.
Sea salt
4 ounces linguine
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil,
divided
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 (6.5-ounce) can minced clams, with
juice
1 (8-ounce) bottle clam juice
3 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf
parsley or parsley paste
⅛ teaspoon white pepper
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season the water generously with
salt. Add the linguine, stir, and cook for 1 minute longer than the
package instructions indicate. Reserve about 1 cup pasta cooking water
when you drain the pasta in a colander. Toss the pasta with 1 tablespoon
olive oil to prevent it from sticking together and allow the pasta to cool
for 5 minutes.
2. Prepare the clam sauce. Add the remaining olive oil to a large sauté pan
and set over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 to 2
minutes. Add the clams, clam juice, parsley, and pepper and simmer for
3 minutes. Add the lemon juice and stir to combine.
3. Remove the clam sauce from the heat and allow to cool. Reserve a
portion of the sauce and pasta for family meals.
4. For the puree, transfer the sauce to a food processor or blender. If
serving over the piped linguine (see Tip in step 5 below), process until
you achieve the desired texture.
5. If pureeing the pasta and the sauce together, add both to a food
processor along with 6 tablespoons reserved pasta cooking water per
serving, and process until you achieve the desired texture.
› Tip: For a more exciting presentation, instead of pureeing the pasta
with the sauce, transfer 1 serving of the pasta to a food processor or
blender. Add 6 tablespoons pasta cooking water and process until
you achieve the desired texture. Add more cooking water if
necessary to achieve the smooth puree. Transfer the pasta puree to a
disposable piping bag and cut off the tip of the bag to form a very
narrow opening. Pipe onto a plate, making thin strips in a circular
motion, until you have created a plate that resembles a mound of
linguine. Cover with plastic wrap until the clam sauce is ready.
6. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.

Zucchini Noodles with Lemon,
Spinach, and Asparagus
SERVINGS: 2 | IDDSI LEVELS
This dish is vegetarian and gluten free. A vegan version may
be made by replacing the parmesan cheese with vegan
cheese. Veggie noodles have 90 percent fewer calories than
pasta. I recommend fresh zucchini spirals made with a home
spiral machine, as frozen spirals get mushy when cooked.
For a topping, Roasted Mushrooms (see here) are a great
pairing.
1½ cups zucchini spirals
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 small bunch asparagus, woody ends
trimmed, peeled if skins are tough,
and cut into 1-inch pieces
1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
¼ teaspoon sea salt
⅛ teaspoon white pepper
1 cup baby spinach leaves
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh parsley
or parsley paste
4 ounces silken tofu, cut into ½-inch dice
¼ cup grated parmesan or vegan
parmesan
1. Place the zucchini spirals in a large skillet over medium heat. Cover the
pan and steam for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the zucchini is
cooked through but not mushy. Transfer the zucchini noodles to a
colander and drain. Reserve.
2. Wipe out the skillet, add the olive oil, and warm over medium heat. Add
the garlic and cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the
asparagus and cook 1 more minute. Add ½ cup vegetable broth and the
lemon juice, season with salt and pepper, and bring to a simmer.
3. Simmer until the asparagus is very tender, about 8 minutes. Add the
remaining ½ cup vegetable broth and the spinach, parsley, and tofu.
Simmer, stirring, until the spinach wilts, about 2 minutes. Add the
parmesan and stir until it melts. Remove from the heat and allow to
cool for 10 minutes.
4. Add the drained zucchini back to the pan and stir to combine. Set aside
any family servings before pureeing.
5. For the puree, add the desired number of ¾-cup portions to a food
processor or blender. Pulse to break up the ingredients and process until
you achieve the desired texture.
6. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
› Tip: For serving, if you want, transfer the puree into a disposable
piping bag. Cut off the tip of the bag to form a very narrow
opening. Pipe onto a plate in a circular motion to create a mound of
spaghetti-like spirals. Alternatively, serve the dish by spooning it
into a colorful bowl.
7. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here. (If you pipe the whole
recipe, any extra piped plates of puree can be placed in a zip-top plastic
bag and stored in the fridge for up to 48 hours or in the freezer for up to
3 months.)

Penne with Pesto
SERVINGS: 2 (PLUS ½ CUP EXTRA PESTO) | IDDSI LEVELS
This is very easy to make, and in addition to pasta, this pesto
will flavor a soup, a vegetable, or a protein. Add a teaspoon
of pesto to Minestrone (see here) or Tomato Sauce (from
Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce, see here) for added depth of
flavor. If you prefer less garlic, reduce the amount of garlic
in the recipe. Basil is the important ingredient in making
pesto, because of its fragrance and flavor. I have used
whole-grain pasta in this recipe, a healthy choice with good
flavor. Make sure to cook it until it is tender so it will puree.
8 ounces whole wheat penne
Sea salt
2 garlic cloves
2 cups fresh basil leaves
½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as
needed
¼ cup grated parmesan
¼ cup raw pine nuts
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season the water generously with
salt, add the penne, and cook for 1 minute longer than the package
instructions indicate. Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water. Drain the
pasta and set aside.
2. Place the garlic and ¼ teaspoon salt in a food processor. Pulse to mince
the garlic. Add the basil and pulse until finely chopped. Use a spatula to
scrape down the sides of the food processor. Add half of the olive oil
and pulse to puree.
3. Add the parmesan and pine nuts and the rest of the olive oil and puree
until you have the consistency of a smooth sauce. Scrape the sides once
more and give the pesto an extra buzz to puree the pine nuts well rather
than leave them crunchy, as in traditional pesto.
› Note: Store any leftover pesto in a container in the refrigerator for
up to 2 weeks or in the freezer for up to a month.
4. In a large bowl, toss the cooked pasta with ¼ cup pesto and ¼ cup pasta
water. Add another splash of olive oil or pasta water as needed so that
the pasta is saucy and nicely coated. If desired, set aside any family
servings before pureeing.
5. For the puree, add the cooked pasta and sauce to a food processor or
blender. Pulse to break down the pasta and puree until you achieve the
desired texture. Add another splash of pasta water if needed to prevent
stickiness.
6. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.

Steaming is an excellent way to prepare vegetables in the dysphagia
kitchen. It is an easy technique for the cook and it preserves flavor and
color. Steaming also preserves nutrients that are lost in boiling. It is
excellent for batch cooking.
Here is a plan you can follow to stock the freezer with assorted vegetables
for quick warming as side dishes for main courses.
I suggest an IDDSI Pureed, Level 4, for vegetable dishes because they
make a great accompaniment to a meal. IDDSI Minced & Moist, Level 5,
or Soft & Bite-Sized, Level 6, may be used, according to individual
assignment by your healthcare provider.
Suggested Steaming Times
For best puree results, steam all vegetables until fork tender.
Artichoke hearts 6 minutes
Asparagus Large: 5
minutes
Small: 4
minutes
Brussels sprouts 10 to 12
minutes
Butternut squash or other winter squash, 2-inch

Basic Steamed Vegetables
With steamed vegetables frozen in individual servings, it is
easy to add any vegetable to a meal. Just follow the
instructions (see Serving, here) for thawing and heating in a
steamer or on the stovetop. These prepared vegetables can
also be added to soups or stews or can be combined to make
vegetable soup. They help add variety in the dysphagia
kitchen, keeping boredom at bay.
Vegetable purees are also flavorful and suitable additions to
family and friend meals. In fact, vegetable purees are often
served as the base for a fine-dining meal.
1. Choose your favorite vegetables, or experiment to see what appeals to
the appetite. Some possibilities include carrots, broccoli, cauliflower,
peas, green beans, zucchini, and butternut squash. A favorite of mine is
parsnips, a relative of carrots.
2. For one steaming session, prep 1½ pounds of a vegetable, enough for 4
servings of ½ cup to 1 cup each. Peel and cut the vegetables as needed.
3. Vegetables should be cut in same-sized pieces for even cooking. Frozen
vegetables work just as well as fresh vegetables and have the same
nutrients. They are easy to store and do not go bad. Especially
convenient is frozen diced butternut squash because it is already peeled.
4. Steam the vegetables. Fill a steamer basket with vegetables and place it
in the steamer of your choice. If using a stovetop method, fill the
bottom of a pot large enough to hold the steamer basket with several
cups of water (only enough to reach just below the steamer basket), and
bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat to medium-low, cover the
pot with a tight-fitting lid, and steam each vegetable for the amount of
time indicated in the list here. (If using another appliance, consult the
directions that come with your steamer for cook times.)
5. When steaming time is up, pierce a few of the vegetables with a sharp
knife to see if they are tender. Remove the steamer basket. Allow the
vegetables to cool. Steaming times for frozen and fresh vegetables are
about the same, but I steam frozen vegetables for a minute less, so they
do not get mushy. I check for tenderness, for a good puree. If desired,
set aside any family servings before pureeing.
6. Puree the vegetables in a food processor or blender with a small amount
of the cooking liquid added. To make sure the puree is smooth, rub the
puree through a mesh strainer with a silicone spatula. This eliminates
any bits of peel, fibrous strings, and seeds. When pureeing vegetables, a
blender will break down the vegetables better.
7. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
8. Serve immediately, or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here.
(Dr. Willett’s book [see Resources] gives a complete nutritional breakdown for a variety of
steamed vegetables.)
PRO TIPS
Keep seasonings simple. Season lightly with salt and white
pepper. A little broth helps to make a smooth and flavorful
puree. Soy sauce may be used instead of salt. Other options
are to season the vegetables with a little olive oil, a squeeze
of lemon juice, and a pinch of parmesan cheese. For a quick
cream sauce, use a good store-bought Alfredo. I am working
on a vegan Alfredo, but it is not yet perfected. Or try a mild,
tomato-based curry from Indian cuisine.
PRO TIPS
Vegetable puree may be added to store-bought soups and
homemade soups and stews, to boost nutrition and enhance
flavor. Vegetable puree may also be added to leftover stirfry, to increase vegetable content and enhance flavor.

Slow-Baked Sweet Potatoes with
Orange
SERVINGS: 8 | IDDSI LEVELS
Sweet potatoes are loaded with nutrients, including fiber,
antioxidants, vitamins A and C, and manganese. They are
delicious with a tart glaze, rather than a more traditional but
overly sweet and sugar-laden topping. This recipe was a
favorite of my mom’s.
4 medium sweet potatoes, approximately
the same size (about 1½ pounds
total)
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons orange marmalade
(preferably lower-sugar)
1 tablespoon honey or brown sugar
(optional)
2 tablespoons orange juice
⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon
Sea salt
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 300°F (150°C).
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Wash and dry the potatoes and
remove any sharp ends, knots, and blemishes. Puncture each potato
three times with a knife to allow steam to escape.
2. Brush the outside of the potatoes with the olive oil and transfer to the
prepared baking sheet, leaving room between them for air to circulate.
Cover with another sheet of foil. Bake for 90 minutes, until the potatoes
are very soft. Remove from the oven, remove the foil, and allow to cool
until the sweet potatoes are easy to handle.
› Tip: For family members who do not need puree, simply take the
soft-baked potato straight out of the oven and serve, topped with the
glaze. Provide an extra bowl of the glaze for additional dipping. If
available, tangerine juice is a great substitute for orange juice.
3. For the puree, remove and discard the skins (they should peel away
easily) and transfer the sweet potato flesh to a bowl. Use a fork or a
potato masher and mash until smooth. Set a mesh strainer or food mill
over another large bowl. Working in batches, rub the sweet potatoes
through the strainer with a silicone spatula, or through the mill, to
remove any remaining fibers.
4. In a small bowl, combine the marmalade and the honey or brown sugar,
if needed, with 3 tablespoons warm water. Rub the mixture through a
mesh strainer with a silicone spatula—to remove any peel that is not
safe for the swallow—into the sweet potato puree. Add the orange juice
and cinnamon and season with salt. Stir to combine. If the mashed
sweet potato is not smooth enough, transfer to a food processor and
puree until smooth.
5. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here.

Mashed Potatoes
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Who would think that making mashed potatoes involves
cooking technique? The great French chef Jacques Pépin
says that if you have a talent for cooking, technique is the
way to showcase your talent. It also saves you time and
labor. Technique is everything when it comes to the humble
but delicious comfort food of mashed potatoes. My favorite
way to make mashed potatoes is to use an Instant Pot or an
electric pressure cooker—this takes only 6 minutes. This
recipe also includes my mom’s secret ingredient for
delicious mashed potatoes: a teaspoon of mayonnaise. And
don’t forget the recipe for Mushroom Gravy (see here),
homemade and quick. The sauce is the medium of flavor.
2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled,
cut into 2-inch dice
1 teaspoon sea salt, plus more to taste
1 tablespoon butter or non-trans-fat
margarine
½ cup warm milk
1 teaspoon mayonnaise
White pepper
1. Add the potatoes, 1 cup water, and 1 teaspoon salt to an electric pressure
cooker. Seal the lid and cook on high for 6 minutes. Allow to come
down from pressure or use the quick release method to allow steam to
escape. The potatoes will be dry, not soggy.
2. If you do not have a pressure cooker, add the potatoes to a large pot,
cover with cold water by 2 inches, and season the water with salt. Bring
to a boil, lower to a simmer, and cook until the potatoes are tender,
about 20 minutes. Drain in a colander and allow them to cool.
3. Once the potatoes have cooled slightly, run them through a potato ricer
or food mill, 1 cup at a time, into a bowl. If you do not have a ricer or
mill, transfer the potatoes to a large bowl and mash them with a potato
masher. Caution: Do not try to mash the potatoes in a food processor or
blender, as this will result in what seems like an appliance full of
library glue.
4. Add the butter, milk, and mayonnaise, season generously with salt and a
pinch of white pepper, and stir until well combined and fluffy.
5. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here.
NUTRITIONAL ANALYSIS PER SERVING | ½ cup
65 calories, 0 g fat, 0 g saturated fat, 11 mg sodium, 0 g sugar, 14 g carbohydrates, 1 g

PRO TIPS
Mashed potatoes freeze better when mixed with a gravy or a
protein and a gravy. When I make dishes such as Roast
Turkey Breast with Lemon and Herbs (see here), I puree the
protein in a food processor with gravy and then gently pulse
in the mashed potatoes, just to combine.
Instant Mashed Potatoes
When you don’t have time to make mashed potatoes from scratch,
try organic potato flakes from Bob’s Red Mill. Prepare according to
package directions but add a teaspoon of mayo for richness. These
are quite tasty and can also be made using gravy or the reserved pan
juices from cooking a chicken or a turkey. Do not over-whip
potatoes made from flakes, as they will get gummy.

Creamed Corn
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Corn makes an excellent side carbohydrate. In summer, I use
fresh corn on the cob. In winter, I buy frozen corn. To
remove the corn kernels from the cob, I like to use a trick
from Ina Garten. Spread a tea towel on your cutting board.
Stand an ear of corn on the towel on one end and run a sharp
knife down the length of the cob to remove the kernels. The
towel keeps the kernels from flying all over the kitchen. It
also keeps the counter clean. Transfer the kernels to a bowl.
4 ears fresh corn on the cob, or 1 (10-
ounce) package frozen corn kernels
¼ cup sour cream
2 tablespoons whole milk
1 tablespoon butter, non-trans-fat
margarine, or extra-virgin olive oil
½ teaspoon sea salt
White pepper
1. Place the corncobs or kernels and 1 cup water into an electric pressure
cooker. Seal the lid and cook on high for 6 minutes. Allow to come
down from pressure or use the quick release method to allow steam to
escape. Alternatively, add the corncobs or kernels to a pot of boiling
water. Cook for 6 minutes, drain, and set aside to cool slightly.
2. Once cool enough to handle, remove the kernels from the corncobs and
transfer to a bowl. Add the sour cream, milk, butter, salt, and a pinch of
white pepper. Stir to coat evenly. If desired, set aside any family
servings before pureeing.
3. Add the corn to a food processor or high-speed blender. Process until
you achieve the desired texture. Set a mesh strainer over a bowl. Using
a silicone spatula, rub the creamed corn through the strainer to remove
any tough bits.
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
5. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,

Grilled Summer Vegetables
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Grilled veggies puree beautifully. The different method of
cooking changes the flavor of the vegetables for the summer
season. The indoor grill has the benefit of adjustable
temperature so that the food does not char, making it unsafe
for the swallow. The food remains moist and juicy, the most
important quality in the dysphagia kitchen. The appliance
also allows for an easy cleanup.
1 pound mushrooms, wiped with a damp
cloth, stems removed, and sliced
2 medium zucchini (about 1 pound), cut
in half vertically and sliced into ¼-inch
half moons
2 onions, sliced into ¼-inch rounds, or 1
bunch scallions, cut into 2-inch pieces
2 red bell peppers, seeds and ribs
removed, sliced into ½-inch wedges
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
Sea salt and white pepper
Fresh lemon juice (optional)
1. Heat an indoor electric grill to 375°F (190°C), or set a grill pan over
medium-high heat. Place the sliced vegetables in a large bowl, add the
olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and toss to coat.
2. Working in batches, spread the vegetables in an even layer on the grill
and cook until tender and lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
Transfer the grilled vegetables to a plate to cool. If desired, set aside
any family servings before pureeing.
3. Transfer the vegetables to a food processor or high-speed blender (do
this in batches if needed). Add ½ cup water and a squeeze of fresh
lemon juice, if desired. Pulse to break up vegetables. Then blend,
adding additional water as needed, until smooth.
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing

Roasted Winter Vegetables
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Prepping the vegetables takes the longest with this dish, but
it is well worth it. If you do not have leeks, use a yellow
onion or shallots—both roast beautifully. Use whatever is on
hand in the fridge. If roasting an entire butternut squash, you
will also have enough to create a quick soup or a savory
snack. Save the green parts of the leeks in a bag in the
freezer and use them when making soup or stock. A good
cook wastes nothing.
1 butternut squash (about 1½ pounds),
halved vertically, seeds removed
1 sweet potato, peeled and cut into 2-
inch cubes
2 leeks, white parts only, cleaned and
sliced into 2-inch pieces
3 carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces
1 parsnip, cut into 2-inch pieces
3 small white turnips, peeled and cut into
¼-inch slices
3 small beets, peeled and cut into ¼-inch
slices
3 garlic cloves, peeled
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Sea salt and white pepper
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment
paper or aluminum foil. Peel one half of the butternut squash and cut it
into 2-inch cubes. (If you have a smaller squash or if you purchased ¾
pound peeled and cut squash, use all of it here. If you have a larger
squash, see Roasted Butternut Squash (here) for what to do with the
other half.)
› Tip: I use a small Chinese cleaver to cut the butternut squash in half
vertically, as it requires muscle power. Insert the tip of the cleaver at
the top of the squash and lean firmly as you lower the cleaver down
the neck and into the body of the vegetable. Simply leveraging your
weight ought to do it. If the peel is difficult to remove when the
squash is raw, then remove the skin after roasting, when it is soft.
2. On the baking sheet, combine the butternut squash cubes with the other
vegetables. Drizzle with the olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and
toss to coat. Roast on the center rack for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes,
toss the chopped vegetables and drizzle with a few tablespoons of water
if they begin to look dry.
3. Continue roasting until the vegetables are very tender and lightly
caramelized, another 10 to 20 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the
oven and allow to cool. If desired, set aside any family servings before
pureeing.
4. Transfer the vegetables to a food processor or high-speed blender (do
this in batches if needed). Add ¼ cup water, pulse a few times to break
up the vegetables, and puree until smooth. Add more water as needed to
achieve the desired texture.
5. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.

Roasted Butternut Squash
Since butternut squash can be large, you might be left with an extra
half. If so, place the half, skin on, cut side down, on another
prepared baking sheet and roast it in the oven along with the mixed
vegetables. This half can be used for another purpose. First remove
the seeds. Use a spoon to remove the flesh from the skin and discard
the skin. The squash can then be pureed on its own as a vegetable
side dish. It can also be pureed with added water or broth (or even a
splash of milk or cream) for a quick soup, or used as a base for
Butternut Squash Quiche (see here).

Roasted Mushrooms
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Use any combination of mushrooms that are available at
your grocery store or farmer’s market. One exception:
shiitakes are probably too woody for this dish. If you would
like to make a topping or gravy for another dish, double the
recipe. Roasted mushroom puree makes a great
accompaniment to a burger or a steak with mashed potatoes.
The soy sauce brings out the flavor of the mushrooms.
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Sea salt and white pepper
1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce
1 pound mushrooms, such as baby Bella
or cremini, trimmed
½ teaspoon thyme paste (optional)
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400°F (205°C).
Brush a baking sheet with 1 tablespoon olive oil. In a large bowl, mix
the remaining olive oil, a pinch of salt and white pepper, and the soy
sauce. Add the mushrooms and toss to coat evenly.
2. Transfer the mushrooms to the baking sheet in a single layer, cap-side
up if using whole mushrooms.

released) to a food processor or high-speed blender. Pulse to break up
the mushrooms and process until almost smooth. For an herbal flavor,
add the thyme and blend. Add water as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time,
and process until you achieve the desired texture.
5. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if thickening is needed; use
IDDSI Testing Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI

Roasted Asparagus
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Most people are familiar with steaming asparagus, but
roasting this vegetable gives it intensity of flavor. Pick a
bunch where all the stalks are roughly the same size so that
they will cook evenly. Thick stalks are better than pencil
asparagus for flavor. For a gourmet touch, use white
asparagus when in season.
1 pound asparagus, woody ends
trimmed, peeled if skins are tough
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
Sea salt and white pepper
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400°F (205°C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, combine the
asparagus, oil, and a pinch of salt and white pepper. Toss thoroughly
with your hands.
2. Line up the stalks on the baking sheet. Sprinkle lemon juice over the
asparagus. Roast until tender, about 12 minutes. Remove from the oven
and allow to cool. Set aside any family servings before pureeing.
3. For the puree, transfer the roasted asparagus to a food processor or highspeed blender. Process until you achieve the desired texture. Set a mesh
strainer over a bowl. Using a silicone spatula, rub the asparagus
through the strainer to remove any fibers.
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing

Spinach and Parmesan Sauté
SERVINGS: 2 | IDDSI LEVELS
Leafy greens are nutrient dense. You can use bagged fresh
spinach or a bunch of fresh spinach; make sure to wash
thoroughly. You can also use frozen chopped spinach.
Spinach will give off water when sautéed, and the liquid
may be used for the puree. The spinach can be served with
scrambled eggs to make a spinach omelet. Spinach puree
freezes beautifully. Make a double recipe if you wish to
freeze individual portions for quick meals.
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 small shallot, thinly sliced (optional)
1 garlic clove, thinly sliced (optional)
1 bunch spinach, or 1 (10-ounce)
package baby spinach
1 teaspoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese
1. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Sauté the shallot until
translucent, about 1 minute. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 more minute.
Add the spinach and stir to coat in the flavored oil. Cook for 2 minutes,
until all the spinach is wilted. Add the lemon juice and the parmesan
and stir until the parmesan melts. Remove from the heat and allow to
cool. If desired, set aside any family servings before pureeing.
2. For the puree, add the spinach (along with any liquid in the skillet) to a
food processor or high-speed blender and puree until smooth, adding a
bit of water as needed to achieve the prescribed texture. Include the
garlic in the puree if you like garlic.
3. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing

Braised Greens
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
One cannot overstate the importance of greens. This is a
terrific way of incorporating them into the diet. Greens
freeze well and may be added to soups and stews. Greens
may also be cooked in an Instant Pot or electric pressure
cooker, following the manufacturer’s instructions for
cooking time. The Instant Pot or electric pressure cooker is
ideal for the quick cooking of collard greens, since collards
normally take a long time and can be tough, but pressurecooking shortens the process.
1 bunch greens (chard, kale, beet
greens, mustard greens, or a
combination)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 small onion, diced
1½ cups low-sodium chicken or
vegetable broth, plus more as needed
Sea salt and white pepper
1. Remove the stalks from the greens. Roll up the leaves and slice them
into ribbons. In a 3-quart pot over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the
onion and sauté until translucent, 3 minutes. Add the greens and sauté
for 2 minutes. Add broth, plus more as needed to just cover the greens.
2. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Bring the broth to a boil, lower
the heat to a simmer, and cover with the lid slightly ajar. Cook until the
greens are very tender, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool. If desired, set
aside any family servings before pureeing.
3. For the puree, add the greens and some of the broth to a food processor
or high-speed blender and process until you achieve the desired texture,
adding additional broth as needed. (Save leftover broth for using in
soups or another puree—it is full of flavor and precious
phytochemicals.)
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if thickening is needed; use
IDDSI Testing Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI
level. See here.

Cooking Whole Grains
The importance of whole grains in the diet cannot be overstated.
They are recommended as heart-healthy by the Harvard T.H. Chan
School of Public Health Healthy Eating Plate, the American Heart
Association, and the American Diabetic Association. They
metabolize slowly and do not spike blood sugar, therefore they do
not produce a spike in insulin. Whole grains are also a tasty and
excellent side dish for a meal.
Cooking grains in batches (also see here) means that you can cook
once and eat multiple times. Having cooked grains in the
refrigerator or freezer also means that you have more choice and
variety in the composition of a meal. You can use any sauce with the
grain, or use the grain to create other dishes.
Make rice and you have the basis of stir-fried rice and rice pudding.
With pressure cooking, the grains may be made in multiple servings
and do not require watching—simply set the timer and open it when
the pressure comes down naturally.
The basic procedure is the same for all of the grains. The best
cooking method is an Instant Pot (or another electric pressure
cooker) or a stovetop pressure cooker. Pressure cooking uses steam
under pressure to force steam through food, keeping the moisture.
The outer coat of the grain softens enough for a smooth puree. You
get the benefits of superior nutrients and also get the fiber.
For the patient with swallowing difficulties, the investment in an
electric pressure cooker is worth it. Follow the directions for your
appliance. After the steam has been released, allow the batch to
cool, then puree and add thickener as needed. (Grains can also be
cooked on the stovetop. Follow the directions in the individual
recipes that follow.)
To store, portion out individual servings into storage containers or
zip-top bags and freeze. Stacking the bags flat in the freezer keeps
them organized and saves space. One shelf of your freezer could
contain frozen individual servings of whole grains, proteins, and
vegetables. This allows you to quickly customize a meal anytime—
just choose a grain, a portion of protein, and a veggie, and voilà!

Rice Congee (Soft Rice Porridge)
SERVINGS: 8 | IDDSI LEVELS
Rice congee, or soft rice porridge, has been used in Asia for
feeding infants and the elderly for thousands of years. I use
brown basmati rice for its flavor, fragrance, and texture.
There are several methods of cooking, including pressure
cooker or stovetop.
2 cups brown basmati rice
¼ teaspoon sea salt
1. Add the rice to a large mixing bowl and wash it several times with cool
tap water, rinsing and draining until the water runs clear. Look for any
green kernels or any little stones and remove them.
2. Pressure cooker method: Add the rice, 5 cups water, and the salt to a
pressure cooker or Instant Pot. Cook on high pressure for 30 minutes.
Allow the pot to come down from pressure by natural release. Remove
the lid and allow the rice to cool. No matter which cooking method one
uses, the rice expands and gives a greater yield.
› Tip: This is a congee. You want it loose, an easily swallowed
porridge rather than a firmly textured grain. You want to break
down the cell wall and get a creamy texture.
Stovetop method: Bring the rice, 4 cups water, and the salt to a boil in
a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir and turn the heat down to
low. Cover and simmer for 45 minutes, until the liquid has been
absorbed.
3. Watch to make sure the bottom does not burn. If necessary, add another
¼ cup of water. Remove from the heat and allow to rest for 5 minutes;
add more water if the rice is dry. Allow to cool.
4. If desired, set aside any family servings before pureeing. For the puree,
add the cooked rice to a food processor or blender and process until you
achieve the desired texture.
5. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
6. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,

Quinoa
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Quinoa is a high-protein grain originally from South
America. It makes a great side dish and may be added to
soups or stews. This method purees the quinoa with water,
but cooked quinoa can also be pureed with broth, soup, or
gravy. Cooked quinoa is delicious added to a winter salad of
braised greens with roasted mushrooms.
2 cups quinoa
¼ teaspoon sea salt
1. Rinse the quinoa in a mesh strainer to eliminate bitterness.
2. Pressure cooking method: Add the quinoa, 2 cups water, and the salt to
a pressure cooker or Instant Pot. Cook on high pressure for 1 minute.
Allow the pot to come down from pressure by natural release. Remove
the lid, fluff the quinoa with a fork, and allow to cool.
Stovetop method: Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a saucepan over
medium-high heat. Add the quinoa and salt, stir, and turn the heat down
to low. Cover and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the liquid has been
absorbed. Remove from the heat, fluff with a fork, and allow to cool.
3. If desired, set aside any family servings before pureeing. For the puree,
add the cooled quinoa and 1½ cups water or broth to a food processor
or blender (you may need to do this in two batches). Pulse to break
down the grain. Process until you achieve the desired texture.
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if thickening is needed; use
IDDSI Testing Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI
level. See here.

Farro
SERVINGS: 4-6 | IDDSI LEVELS
I prefer to use Bob’s Red Mill Organic Whole Grain Farro,
as I think it has the best flavor. The pressure cooker is the
shortest method, or you can soak the grains overnight in
water to cut down on cooking time if cooking on a stovetop.
1 cup farro
½ teaspoon salt
1. Rinse the farro in a mesh strainer.
2. Pressure cooker method: Add the farro, 3 cups water, and the salt to a
pressure cooker or Instant Pot. Cook on high pressure for 20 minutes.
Allow the pot to come down from pressure by natural release. Remove
the lid, fluff the farro with a fork, and allow to cool.
Stovetop method: Bring 2 quarts of water or broth to a boil in a pot
with salt. Add the farro, then return the heat to medium-high and boil,
uncovered, until soft and tender, approximately 30 minutes. Drain off
excess liquid, fluff with a fork, and allow to cool. Test for tenderness. If
more tenderness is desired, cover and allow to stand for several
minutes.
3. If desired, set aside any family servings before pureeing. For the puree,
add the cooked farro to a food processor or high-speed blender and
process until you achieve the desired texture.
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if thickening is needed; use
IDDSI Testing Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI

Buckwheat
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Buckwheat has a nutty, delicious flavor and makes an
excellent side dish. Buckwheat is gluten-free and is not a
member of the wheat family. It is good for diabetics because
it slows the absorption of glucose. I prefer to use Bob’s Red
Mill Organic Whole Grain Buckwheat Groats.
1 cup whole-grain buckwheat groats,
lightly toasted in a dry cast-iron or
stainless steel skillet
¼ teaspoon salt
1. Pressure cooker method: Add the toasted buckwheat, 1¾ cups water
or broth, and the salt to a pressure cooker. Secure the lid. Cook on high
pressure for 12 minutes. Allow the pot to come down from pressure by
natural release. Unlock and remove the lid. Fluff the buckwheat with a
fork, and allow to cool.
Stovetop method: Bring 2½ cups water or broth to a boil in a pot on
the stove. Add the toasted buckwheat and salt. Return to a boil, then
reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until tender, about 15
minutes. Drain off excess liquid, fluff with a fork, and allow to cool.
2. If desired, set aside any family servings before pureeing. For the puree,
add the cooked buckwheat to a food processor or blender and process
until you achieve the desired texture.
3. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
4. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,

Barley
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
Barley has a nutty, delicious flavor and may be added to
soups or bowls, or served as a side dish. I recommend Bob’s
Red Mill Pearl Barley.
1 cup pearled barley
1 teaspoon salt
1. Rinse the barley in a mesh strainer.
2. Pressure cooker method: Combine barley, 4 cups water, and the salt in
a pressure cooker or Instant Pot. Cook on high pressure for 20 minutes.
Allow the pot to come down from pressure by natural release. Remove
the lid, fluff the barley with a fork, and allow to cool.
Stovetop method: Bring 2 quarts water to a boil in a pot and add the
barley and salt. Return to medium-high heat and boil, uncovered, until
soft, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain off excess liquid, fluff with a fork, and
allow to cool.
3. If desired, set aside any family servings before pureeing. For the puree,
add the cooked barley to a food processor or high-speed blender and

Grits
SERVINGS: 8-10 | IDDSI LEVELS
Grits are made from cornmeal and are a close cousin to
polenta. The recommended kinds are stone-ground,
unenriched, and coarse. They may be flavored to suit your
palate. I prefer Bob’s Red Mill Creamy White Corn Grits.
1 cup white corn grits
Milk, as needed (see method)
½ teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
4 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon onion powder
1. Pressure cooker method: Add the grits, 3½ cups water, ½ cup milk,
and salt to a pressure cooker or Instant Pot. Cook on high pressure for
10 minutes. Allow the pot to come down from pressure by natural
release.
Stovetop method: Bring 2 cups water and 2 cups milk to a boil in a pot
and add the salt and grits. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for about 30
minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is absorbed and the grits
are creamy. Remove from heat.
2. Season with the butter, parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and onion
powder. Stir to combine thoroughly. Cover and let stand for 1 to 2
minutes.
3. If desired, set aside any family servings before pureeing. For the puree,
add the cooked grits to a food processor or blender and process until
you achieve the desired texture.

Beans
SERVINGS: 6-12 | IDDSI LEVELS
Beans are an important source of protein, especially for
vegetarians and vegans. One can make beans in a pressure
cooker without presoaking. This stress-free method of
cooking is a big labor and time-saver. The cooking methods
are the same for all beans, but each type of bean has a
different cooking time. A great way to serve beans is with
Rice Congee (see here) for the classic dish of rice and beans.
This is a favorite in the Cuban kitchen. Red beans and rice is
a staple in New Orleans.
2 cups dry beans, rinsed and sorted
1 onion, sliced
1½ teaspoons salt
1. Pressure cooker method: Add the beans and onion to a pressure cooker
or Instant Pot. Cover with about 1½ inches of water over the level of
the beans. (Do not fill the inner pot of your Instant Pot more than half
full.) Add herbs and spices: a bay leaf or oregano and parsley for
cannellini or chickpeas; cumin for pinto beans.
› Note: Soaking is not necessary for pressure-cooked beans. If not
pressure cooking, beans will cook faster if they are soaked. If they
are not soaked, the cooking time will be longer.
Stovetop method: If you have time, soak the beans overnight in water
to rehydrate. Then drain and cook as follows. Add the beans and onion
to a pot. Cover with about 1 inch of water over the level of the beans.
Add herbs and spices: a bay leaf or oregano and parsley for cannellini
or chickpeas; cumin for pinto beans.
2. Pressure cooker method: Cook on high for the amount of time
specified in the following chart. Allow the pressure to come down by
natural release. Remove the lid, remove bay leaf, and stir to combine.
Allow the beans to cool.
Stovetop method: Bring the beans to a boil, then lower to a simmer.
Check the beans after 1 hour for tenderness. If they are not tender,
continue to cook and check. Cooking times vary depending upon the
type and age of the beans.
3. If desired, set aside any family servings before pureeing. For the puree,
add the cooked beans to a food processor or blender and process until
you achieve the desired texture.
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
5. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here. (Freeze for up to 1 month,

Brown Lentils
YIELD: 2 CUPS | IDDSI LEVELS
Lentils are a powerhouse of nutrition, providing protein for
those on vegetarian and vegan diets. They may be used to
make delicious soups and stews and used as a side dish. A
variety of lentils may be found in your local market,
including green lentils, French green lentils, brown lentils,
and black lentils. Check packages for cooking times. There
is no need to soak lentils in advance of cooking. Red lentils
do not do well in an Instant Pot or pressure cooker.
1 cup brown lentils
2 cups water or vegetable broth
¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
1 bay leaf
½ teaspoon salt
1. Pressure cooker method: Rinse and pick over the lentils, discarding
any broken lentils or stones. Add the lentils, water or broth, and
seasonings to a pressure cooker or Instant Pot. Cook on high pressure
for 10 minutes. Allow the pot to come down from pressure by natural
release. Remove the lid. If you added a bay leaf earlier, remove it.
Allow the lentils to cool. Add the salt and stir to mix.
Stovetop method: Rinse and pick over the lentils, discarding any
broken lentils or stones. Add the lentils, water or broth, and seasonings
to a saucepan. Bring to a rapid simmer over medium-high heat. Lower
the heat to a gentle simmer and cook uncovered, for twenty to thirty
minutes. Add water as needed to make sure the lentils are just covered.
Lentils are done when tender. If you added a bay leaf earlier, remove it.
Allow the lentils to cool. Add the salt and stir to mix.
2. If desired, set aside any family servings before pureeing. For the puree,
add the cooked lentils to a food processor or blender and process until
you achieve the desired texture.
3. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,

Steel-Cut Oatmeal with Yogurt and
Honey
SERVINGS: 1 | IDDSI LEVELS
Steel-cut oats are less processed and have more fiber and
less sugar than the packaged instant oatmeal varieties. For a
labor-saving device, I use a mini rice cooker. It makes
smooth oatmeal, and you don’t have to stand over the stove
and stir.
1 cup water
¼ cup steel-cut oats, 5-minute variety
Sea salt
Ground cinnamon (optional)
⅓ medium banana*
, sliced into ¼-inch
slices (optional)
½ cup whole milk
¼ cup whole Greek yogurt
1 teaspoon honey
Check with your healthcare provider to see if you can include pureed banana. This will
boost the nutrient level.
1. Rice cooker method: In a rice cooker, combine the water, oats, a pinch
of salt, and a dash of cinnamon, if using. Cook according to the rice
cooker instructions, or until the oatmeal is soft. If it needs more time,
continue cooking until the grains are very tender. Add extra water,
several tablespoons at a time, if the oatmeal dries out.
Stovetop method: Bring the water to a boil in a small saucepan set
over high heat. Stir in the oats, a pinch of salt, and a dash of cinnamon,
if using. Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring
occasionally and adding liquid as needed, until the oats are tender,
about 20 minutes.
2. If desired, set aside any family servings before pureeing. For the puree,
once the oatmeal cools, transfer it to a food processor or high-speed
blender. Add the banana, if using, and pulse to break it up. Add the
milk, yogurt, and honey. Process until you achieve the desired texture.
3. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if thickening is needed; use

Butternut Squash Quiche
SERVINGS: 8 | IDDSI LEVELS
For the person with a swallowing disorder, the quiche filling
is a custard, Level 4 IDDSI. For family and friends, the crust
may be served with the dish.
1 store-bought or homemade pie crust
(see here)
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
½ cup sliced mushrooms
1½ teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce
½ cup yellow onion, thinly sliced
2 cups cooked, pureed butternut squash
(see here)
¼ cup milk (could substitute water for
depth of veggie flavor)
4 extra-large eggs, lightly beaten
4 ounces goat cheese, room temperature
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
leaves or thyme paste
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375°F (190°C).
2. Press the pie crust into an even layer in a 9-inch tart pan with a
removable bottom. Place the pan on a baking sheet. Prick the crust with
a fork several times. Bake for 10 minutes, until the surface of the crust
is dry to the touch. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.
3. Meanwhile, in a skillet or sauté pan, add 1 tablespoon olive oil over
medium-low heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally,
until they are soft and give up their liquid, about 10 minutes. Add the
soy sauce. Remove the mushrooms from the pan and set aside on a
plate.
4. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, raise the heat to medium-high, and sauté the
onion until it is lightly golden, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat
and allow to cool.
5. Place the onion and mushrooms in a food processor or high-speed
blender. Pulse a few times to break up the vegetables, then puree to a
smooth consistency, adding warm water, a tablespoon at a time if
necessary, to get a smooth puree. Add the butternut squash, milk,
beaten eggs, goat cheese, and thyme. Blend until smooth.
6. Add the quiche filling to the cooled crust. Bake for 15 minutes. Lower
the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) and bake for an additional 35
minutes, or until a toothpick or knife inserted into the filling comes out
clean. Transfer the quiche to a cooling rack to cool.
7. Slice and serve portions for family meals. The quiche filling, scooped
out of the crust, is IDDSI Level 4 and can be enjoyed by the person
with swallowing difficulties without pureeing.
8. If you wish to serve the crust, place the desired number of slices in a
food processor or high-speed blender. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons warm
water or broth per slice. Process until you achieve the desired texture.
Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
9. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,

PRO TIPS
If I do not have time to roast butternut squash to make the
quiche, I use Birds Eye Southland frozen pureed butternut
squash from the freezer section of the grocery store as the
base for the quiche. I thaw it in the fridge before adding it to
the recipe. You can also use 21 ounces of fresh cubed
butternut squash. Cook in the microwave for about 8
minutes. Remove the skin if it is not peeled off. According
to a recipe tester, this is perfect for puree. Once the squash is
pureed, run it through a mesh sieve to eliminate fibers, skin,
and seeds, which are not safe for the swallow.

Blintzes with Blueberry Sauce and
Sour Cream
SERVINGS: 3 | IDDSI LEVELS
Blintzes are crepe-like pancakes filled with a ricotta and
cream cheese mixture and were a favorite of the gangster
Meyer Lansky. Blintzes are generally available at
supermarkets, but if you want to make your own, recipes can
be found online.
1 batch of homemade cheese blintzes
(see link above) or frozen purchased
blintzes
2 teaspoons unsalted butter or nontrans-fat margarine
Blueberry Sauce (see here) (may be
made with frozen blueberries)
Low-fat sour cream
1. Make the homemade blintzes according to the recipe and freeze any
extras in a zip-top bag. Use freshly made blintzes or defrost frozen
blintzes in the refrigerator for 2 hours. In a small nonstick pan, melt the
butter or margarine. Add the cooked blintzes and warm. Or add the
frozen blintzes and cook following the package directions.
2. For family meal servings, top each blintz with a generous amount,
several tablespoons, of Blueberry Sauce and a dollop of sour cream.
3. For the puree, cool the blintzes. Break up 2 blintzes per serving into a
food processor or blender. Add 2 tablespoons Blueberry Sauce and 1
tablespoon sour cream for each blintz. Process until you achieve the
desired texture.
4. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
5. Serve immediately or divide into servings for storage or freezing,
following the directions for Serving, here.

358 calories, 21 g fat, 8 g saturated fat, 176 mg sodium, 17 g sugar, 30 g carbohydrates, 0
g fiber, 11 g protein
PRO TIPS
When you puree any dish with ricotta cheese, the volume
increases because of the incorporated air; one serving will
look much larger after pureeing than before. The blintzes are
light in taste and texture because of the air, but the
nutritional content is the same. The added volume does not
change the nutrients.
Blueberry Sauce
YIELD: 1 CUP | IDDSI LEVELS
Any homemade fruit sauce is more delicious and
nutritious than the flavored syrups for pancakes you
can buy bottled. This sauce has the added virtue of
flexibility—add it to oatmeal or any other hot cereal or
to ice cream for a nutrition boost, and it can be made
from blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, cherries,
mango, or kiwi.
1 pint blueberries, washed, or 8
ounces frozen blueberries
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
¼ cup maple syrup, honey, or agave
syrup
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1. Place the blueberries and 1 cup water in a high-speed blender.
Blend on high until the fruit is liquefied. Run the liquefied fruit
through a mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth.
2. Place the strained blueberry puree in a saucepan and set over
medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to
medium-low. Add the lemon juice and sweetener and simmer
gently for 5 minutes.
3. In a small bowl, whisk the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water
to make a slurry. Add the slurry to the sauce, return the heat to
medium-high, and bring the sauce back to a boil. Cook, stirring
occasionally, until the sauce is thickened and the raw taste of
cornstarch disappears.
4. Remove from the heat and allow the sauce to cool for 10
minutes; set aside any desired family servings.
5. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI
Testing Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI
level. See here.
6. Serve immediately, refrigerate for up to 48 hours, or freeze for
up to 3 months. Store in ½-cup individual servings (for pureeing
two blintzes).

Scrambled Eggs and Mashed
Potatoes
SERVINGS: 1 | IDDSI LEVELS
I found that it was difficult to puree home fries for a classic
American accompaniment to breakfast, because there were
hard particles in the puree. The mashed potatoes deliver
flavor and are a good substitute for home fries.
3 large eggs, lightly beaten
1½ tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon unsalted butter or nontrans-fat margarine
½ cup Mashed Potatoes (see here)
1. In a small bowl, beat the eggs and milk. Melt the butter in a nonstick
skillet over medium-low heat. Add the eggs to the pan, reduce the heat
to low, and cook, stirring with a silicone spatula, until the desired
consistency is reached.
2. Remove the pan from the heat. The eggs should be the consistency of
custard, IDDSI Level 4 (see here).
3. Warm the mashed potatoes for 30 seconds in the microwave. The
mashed potatoes should be the consistency of custard, IDDSI Level 4,
when prepared according to the recipe.
4. For serving, place the eggs in one dish and potatoes in a second dish and
alternate bites.
5. Make this on the day it is to be consumed. Do not store in the freezer.
May be held overnight in the fridge.

The Motor City Shake
SERVINGS: 3 | IDDSI LEVEL
This is a warm sweet potato pie shake with an optional
whipped topping and optional caramel sauce. The orange
juice balances the sweetness of the sweet potato. Coconut
milk provides fat for proper absorption of vitamin A. Use
more or less of the soft-baked sweet potato to get the correct
thickness. You can substitute canned sweet potato with no
added sugar, if time is too short to slow-bake the sweet
potato.
4 medium sweet potatoes, or 1 (15-
ounce) can sweet potato puree
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup coconut milk or whole milk
2 tablespoons orange juice
⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon
⅛ teaspoon ground allspice
⅙ teaspoon ground cloves
Honey or stevia to taste
CocoWhip topping or Toasted Cashew
Cream (see here) (optional)
Store-bought caramel sauce, such as St.
Dalfour (optional)
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 300°F (150°C).
Wash and dry the potatoes and cut off any sharp ends or blemishes.
Puncture each potato three times with a knife to allow steam to escape.
2. Place the potatoes in a baking dish, leaving room between them for air
to circulate. Brush the skins with the oil and cover tightly with
aluminum foil. Bake for 90 minutes, until very soft. Remove from oven
and allow to cool.
3. Once cool, remove and discard the potato skins, scraping out the potato
flesh and transferring it to a large mixing bowl. Mash with a fork until
soft and smooth. Using a silicone spatula, rub the mash through a mesh
strainer to remove any fibers.
4. Transfer the mashed sweet potato to a blender with the milk, juice, and
spices, and blend until thoroughly combined. Taste and add honey or
stevia if you would like a sweeter shake.
› Tip: If you would like to serve the shake warm, transfer to a pot and
warm over medium-low heat. I use a high-speed blender for making
this, set on warming setting for 2 minutes.
5. If desired, set aside any family servings before thickening. Test for
Level 3 IDDSI. If the shake is thick enough without adding thickener, it
is all right to consume. If it is not thick enough, add thickener to
achieve Level 3 IDDSI. See iddsi.org and here.
6. Serve immediately, topped with Toasted Cashew Cream and caramel
sauce, if using, or divide into servings for storage or freezing, following
the directions for Serving, here.

half scoop of powder to bind the whipped topping.
Recipe courtesy of Dr. Denise Pickett-Bernard, PhD, RDN, LDN.
1 cup raw cashews
¾ cup water, plus extra for blending
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1. Place the cashews in a dry skillet over medium-low heat and
toast, stirring frequently, until lightly golden, 2 to 4 minutes.
Transfer the cashews to a high-speed blender.
2. Add ¾ cup water and the maple syrup and blend until
completely smooth. Add more water, if necessary, to get a
pureed thickness. Best to always make this fresh.

The Memphis Shake
SERVINGS: 2 | IDDSI LEVEL
It is said that the peanut butter and banana sandwich was
Elvis Presley’s favorite. This recipe uses peanut butter
powder, because it is low in fat and blends easily. You can
substitute 1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter. I know the
King liked bacon. Since you cannot puree bacon, I like to
use bacon dust on top of the shake to get the flavor. It can be
purchased online—I like Bacon Lovers Seasoning by Flavor
God.
2 bananas*
, cut into 1-inch chunks,
frozen
2 tablespoons organic peanut butter
powder, whisked with 2 tablespoons
water until smooth
½ cup whole milk or nondairy milk,
chilled
Honey or stevia, to taste
Bacon Lovers Seasoning by Flavor God
(optional)
Check with your healthcare provider to see if you can include pureed banana. This will
boost the nutrient level.
1. Add the bananas, hydrated peanut butter powder, milk, and sweetener to
a blender. Blend until smooth, adding more milk if needed.
2. If desired, set aside any family servings before thickening. Test for
Level 3 IDDSI. If the shake is thick enough without adding thickener, it
is all right to consume. If it is not thick enough, add thickener to Level
3 IDDSI. See iddsi.org and here.
3. Sprinkle bacon dust on top of the shake, if using, and serve immediately
(this is best consumed fresh). The extra serving may be refrigerated and
served within 24 hours. Before serving, simply blend it up to mix the
thickener well.

Mango Lassi
SERVINGS: 2 | IDDSI LEVEL
Lassi is a refreshing Indian yogurt shake made with fruit,
fruit juice, and yogurt. A probiotic-rich fermented food,
yogurt supports digestion, while fresh fruit adds fiber. Store
in the fridge overnight and drink within 24 hours; it is best
served fresh. Lassi does not have the high sugar content of a
classic American milkshake made with ice cream. This
recipe can be doubled or tripled for several people.
2 tablespoons honey, optional, whisked
1 cup frozen mango chunks
1 cup buttermilk, or ¾ cup Greek yogurt
plus ¼ cup buttermilk
½ tablespoon fresh lime juice (from ½
lime)
1 scoop whey protein powder or plantbased protein powder, optional
½ teaspoon ginger juice or ½ teaspoon
dried ginger, optional
1. Dissolve the honey in 2 tablespoons hot water. Add the mango to a
high-speed blender and pulse to break up the fruit.
2. Add the dissolved honey, buttermilk, lime juice, protein powder, and
ginger juice, or dried ginger, if using. Blend until smooth.
3. If desired, set aside any family servings before thickening. Test for
Level 3 IDDSI. If the shake is thick enough without adding thickener, it
is all right to consume. If it is not thick enough, add thickener to
achieve Level 3 IDDSI. See iddsi.org and here.
4. Serve immediately (this is best consumed fresh). The extra serving may
be refrigerated and served within 24 hours. Before serving, simply
blend it up to mix the thickener well.

Cathie G.’s Banana Cream Pie
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVELS
I experimented for a long time to create this recipe. Banana
Cream Pie was my mom’s favorite dessert. The trick to
making this pie for the puree kitchen is a flavorful banana
puree—don’t try to make this with bright yellow, firm
bananas. Choose fruit with well-browned skins, but avoid
black and squishy bananas. You may substitute almond or
oat milk for the dairy milk. The ingredients are layered in a
clear glass for a pretty parfait effect. If you wish, put the
whipped topping in a pastry bag fitted with a star tip for a
professional look.
FOR THE CRUST
3 cups graham cracker crumbs (about 12
graham crackers processed in a food
processor)
2 tablespoons raw cane sugar or Truvia
Sweet Complete Granulated stevia
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, more if
desired
FOR THE PUDDING
4 very ripe bananas, coarsely mashed
2½ cups whole milk or milk of choice,
divided
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
2 tablespoons coconut oil or unsalted
butter, melted
Pinch of sea salt
Pinch of ground turmeric, for color
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup thawed frozen coconut milk
whipped dessert topping (see Tip)
To make the crust:
1. Pulse the graham cracker crumbs, sugar or stevia, and cinnamon in a
food processor or blender until finely ground into a sand-like texture.
Add about 6 tablespoons very hot water, pulse, and let soften, adding
more water if needed.
2. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
This is your crust. It is the base of the dessert. Spread the crust mixture
evenly into 4 serving bowls. Refrigerate to chill and set while you make
the pudding.
To make the pudding:
1. Process the bananas in a food processor or blender until very smooth
and lump-free. Add 2 cups milk, maple syrup, coconut oil, salt, and
turmeric and pulse to combine.
2. Put the cornstarch in a medium saucepan. Add the remaining ½ cup
milk and whisk until smooth. Add the banana mixture and whisk until
combined. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until
simmering.
3. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, still whisking to avoid scorching on
the bottom, for 1 minute. Divide the pudding evenly among 4 serving
bowls over the crust.
4. Let stand until cooled, about 30 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours. Serve chilled, topped with the
whipped topping. This may be stored covered in the refrigerator for up
to 2 days (I do not recommend freezing this).
› Tip: I prefer whipped coconut milk topping (my favorite is So
Delicious CocoWhip), because freshly whipped dairy cream tends
to separate as it stands. Add one half pump of gel thickener or half
scoop of powder to bind the whipped topping.

Texas Sheet Cake with Oh-SoDelicious Chocolate Frosting
SERVINGS: 12 | IDDSI LEVELS
This flat chocolate cake is naturally moist and blends into a
smooth, crumb-free puree. The frosting is made with
Nocciolata, a hazelnut-cocoa spread that will remind you of
another Italian nut spread. But I prefer Nocciolata because it
doesn’t have trans fats, is generally more nutritious, and has
a smoother texture for the swallow. For an extra treat, serve
with whipped coconut milk topping (see Tip, here, step 8).
FOR THE CAKE
Nonstick cooking spray for the pan
2 cups whole-wheat pastry flour
1¾ cups sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon sea salt
½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into
pieces
⅓ cup natural cocoa powder, such as
Hershey’s
1 cup sour cream
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
FOR THE FROSTING
1 cup organic chocolate hazelnut spread,
preferably Nocciolata
¾ cup full-fat sour cream, plus more as
needed for the puree
2 tablespoons whole milk, plus more as
needed
1. To make the cake, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat
to 350ºF. Spray the inside of an 18 x 13-inch half-sheet pan with
nonstick spray.
2. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl.
Bring 1 cup water, the butter, and the cocoa powder to a boil in a
medium saucepan over high heat, stirring until the butter is melted. Add
to the flour mixture and whisk until combined. Add the sour cream, the
eggs, and vanilla and whisk again to combine.
3. Spread evenly in the prepared pan. Bake until the cake springs back
when lightly pressed on top and pulls away slightly from the sides, 20
to 22 minutes. Let cool completely.
4. To make the frosting, mash the hazelnut spread and ¾ cup sour cream
together with a sturdy spoon or silicone spatula to a pudding-like
consistency, adding milk by the tablespoon, as needed. Transfer to a
pastry bag fitted with a ½-inch star tip.
5. If desired, set aside any family servings before pureeing, and serve with
frosting piped onto the cake.
6. To puree the cake, break up the desired number of servings into a food
processor or blender. Pulse the cake into crumbs. Add 2 tablespoons
sour cream per serving and 3 tablespoons very hot water and process
into a puree, adding more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed.
Transfer to a bowl.
7. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
Divide the pureed cake portions evenly among serving or storage bowls
with 1 or 2 tablespoons of frosting piped over top.
8. Serve with thickened whipped topping (see Tip, here), if desired, or
cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 48 hours or freeze for
up to 1 month.
› Tip: I prefer whipped coconut milk topping (my favorite is So
Delicious CocoWhip), because freshly whipped dairy cream tends
to separate as it stands. Add one half pump of gel thickener or half
scoop of powder to bind the whipped topping.

Pumpkin Flan
SERVINGS: 4 | IDDSI LEVEL
A perfect dessert for a holiday meal. I use St. Dalfour
Organic Caramel Sauce for its convenience. It contains
natural sugars as opposed to refined sugar. This caramel
sauce is a go-to quickie ingredient. It has the consistency of
honey. As I have been told by three speech-language
pathologists, if the caramel is of the same thickness as the
custard, the dish is safe for the swallow. Dipping sauce
may be Level 3 IDDSI, Moderately Thick. Caramel sauce is
optional. As always, clear this dish with your healthcare
provider.
4 teaspoons store-bought caramel
sauce, such as St. Dalfour
4 large eggs, room temperature, lightly
beaten
1½ cups whole milk or coconut milk
½ cup maple syrup
¾ cup pumpkin puree, unseasoned
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground allspice
1½ teaspoons ground ginger
⅛ teaspoon ground cloves
¼ teaspoon salt
EQUIPMENT
Aluminum foil
4 (6-ounce) porcelain ramekins, oven
and dishwasher safe, available online
and in stores
1. Make an aluminum foil sling for four 6-ounce (¾ cup) porcelain custard
ramekins. For each sling, fold a 12-inch-long piece of aluminum foil
into thirds lengthwise. Place under the ramekin and fold the tops
together to secure the sling.
2. This is your device for removing the ramekins from the pressure cooker.
Using a ramekin as a stencil, cut four disks from another sheet of foil to
cover the top of the custard in each ramekin. Place 1 teaspoon caramel
sauce into the bottom of each ramekin. Swirl the ramekin so the
caramel covers the bottom.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, and maple syrup until smooth.
Add the pumpkin puree and spices and whisk until blended thoroughly.
Divide the mixture among the ramekins.
4. Cover the top of each ramekin with a foil disk and place each in its foil
sling.
5. Pressure cooker method: Lower the ramekins into the steamer rack of
the pressure cooker. Fill the bottom of the pressure cooker with water,
just below the steamer rack. Cook on high pressure for 20 minutes;
allow pressure to release naturally.
Stovetop method: Alternatively, place a steamer basket in a large pot
on the stove, add water to fill just below the base of the basket, and
bring the water to a boil. Carefully lower the ramekins into the
steaming basket. Lower the heat, cover, and steam until the custard is
just set, 30 to 45 minutes.
6. Once done, remove the lid and transfer the ramekins to a cooling rack to
cool completely. Refrigerate for 4 hours before serving.
7. To serve, gently remove the aluminum foil cover from the custard. Run
a knife under warm water and loosen the custard by running the knife
around the edge of the ramekin. Using a saucer or a shallow bowl,
cover the top of the ramekin and flip it to turn the custard out. The
caramel will be on top. Serve immediately, or store, covered, in the
refrigerator for up to 2 days. (I do not recommend freezing.)

Thickened Ice Cream
SERVINGS: 1 | IDDSI LEVEL
Why would a person with dysphagia want homemade frozen
dessert? The answer is simple: variety.
Ice cream is the most popular and most beloved dessert in America.
Commercially available thickened desserts only come in basic flavors.
When you want your favorite ice cream and your favorite ice cream is not
available, here is the answer. Using this recipe, you can thicken your
favorite ice cream. It is important to thicken the ice cream so that it will not
melt down to a liquid but remain safe for the swallow. Get clearance from
your healthcare provider to thicken your favorite ice cream if it
contains fruit (such as cherries) or nuts. Do not attempt to thicken ice
cream that contains marshmallows, sprinkles, hard candy, toffee, or cookie
bits, as these are not safe for the swallow.
1 cup ice cream
1. Let the ice cream soften for 15 minutes at room temperature or in the
refrigerator. Put the softened ice cream in a blender. Puree on high for
10 seconds, until completely smooth. If any particles remain in the
blended ice cream, use a silicone spatula to rub it through a mesh
strainer set over a medium bowl.
2. Test for Level 4 IDDSI. If the ice cream is thick enough without adding
a thickener, it is all right to consume; if needed, add a thickening agent.
See iddsi.org and here. Serve immediately, or refreeze. Can be stored in
the freezer for up to 1 week.

The Ice Cream Sandwich
SERVINGS: 1 | IDDSI LEVEL
This is a deconstructed dessert recipe for the classic ice
cream sandwich, using chocolate cake and thickened vanilla
ice cream. It is festive. Designed to delight. A treat for the
eyes and the palate. Since this is a quickie recipe, I am
recommending a store-bought cake, preferably without icing
(or with the icing removed); alternatively, you can make
your favorite cake with no icing. To make a diabetic version
of this dessert, buy no-sugar-added ice cream and a nosugar-added cake, as your healthcare provider recommends.
2 servings store-bought chocolate cake,
without icing
2 tablespoons sour cream
¼ cup Thickened Ice Cream (see here)
1. Break up the cake into a food processor or blender. Pulse several times
to break down the cake into granules. Add 2 tablespoons warm water
and the sour cream and puree to combine. Add 2 more tablespoons
warm water, as needed, and process until you achieve the desired
texture.
2. Test for Level 4 IDDSI. If the cake puree is thick enough without
adding a thickener, it is all right to consume; if needed, add a
thickening agent. See iddsi.org and here.
3. To serve an ice cream sandwich, spread 2 tablespoons of the cake puree
in the base of a small bowl. Spread the thickened ice cream over the
top. Top with 2 more tablespoons cake puree. Place in the freezer for 10
minutes to firm up before serving. Can be stored in the freezer for up to
1 week.

Raspberry “Ice Cream”
YIELD: 3 CUPS | IDDSI LEVEL
These instructions are for a raspberry “ice cream” that
remains in a pudding consistency when it melts. It uses food
thickener to achieve this result. This recipe uses whole dairy
milk, but it may be made dairy-free by substituting nondairy
milk, such as coconut milk, soy milk, cashew milk, or
almond milk. The best choices are whole milk or coconut
milk. The texture will be thinner with nondairy milks. I used
a stevia-based sweetener, Truvia Sweet Complete
Granulated, a powder that has no aftertaste, rather than
refined white sugar.
1 pound frozen raspberries
1 cup whole milk or nondairy milk
1½ to 2 tablespoons Truvia Sweet
Complete Granulated stevia or sugar,
plus more if desired
1. Add the frozen fruit to a food processor or high-speed blender. Pulse
just until the fruit is liquefied. With a silicone spatula, scrape down the
sides of the container and rub the puree through a mesh strainer to
eliminate any skin, fiber, or seeds.
2. Add the milk and sweetener and process until smooth. Use a spatula to
scrape down the sides of the container. This will ensure that the texture
is consistent throughout the puree. For each cup fruit, use the same
amount of thickener you would use to thicken 4 ounces of liquid to
IDDSI Level 4.
3. For gel thickener, this is double the amount of IDDSI Level 3 thickener.
For powder thickeners, follow the manufacturer’s directions. Test for
Level 4 IDDSI (see iddsi.org and here). If the “ice cream” is thick
enough without adding additional thickener, it is all right to consume. If
needed, add more thickening agent.
4. Transfer the puree to glass storage containers, cover, and store in the
freezer. Soften in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours before serving. Don’t
store in the freezer for more than 1 week for the best texture.

g fiber, 1.3 g protein
VARIATIONS
Use other frozen fruits instead of raspberries: peaches, pineapple,
mangoes, blueberries, or cherries. Pineapple is best used with a nutrition
extractor like a Nutribullet, which will pulverize the cell walls, because
pineapple is fibrous. The recipe calls for frozen fruit, but you can substitute
fresh fruit by freezing it in a plastic zip bag in the freezer for two hours
before using.
Cook-and-Serve Pudding
The instant pudding mix that you buy in boxes in the grocery store
contains sugar, preservatives, and additives. The pudding recipes
that follow use stevia powder. Each recipe makes five batches of
pudding mix; each batch contains four servings. There is enough, in
other words, for family and friends. Stored on a shelf in a cool dry
place, the pudding mixes last for a month. Freeze the mix and it will
last three months. For a vegan version, substitute coconut milk
powder and coconut milk or cream.
Making the pudding takes less than 10 minutes on the stove. And the
cleanup is easy, too, if you get the pudding pot rinsed in hot water
right away. If you would like to top your pudding with whipped
cream, I recommend a whipped coconut topping (I like So Delicious
CocoWhip) because, unlike dairy whipped cream, it will not
separate. Use whipped cream only if you are thickening a small
amount for immediate consumption.
PRO TIPS
Make a chocolate topping as follows: Test your favorite
chocolate syrup for Pureed, IDDSI Level 4. If the topping is
the same thickness as the frozen dessert, it will be safe for
the swallow. Add a thickener if needed. Transfer topping to a
chef's squirt bottle for ease in adding to desserts.

This instant pudding mix contains no added sugar, additives,
or preservatives. It is made with vanilla powder, which is
easier to use than vanilla extract. Make the pudding mix, and
store it in a cool dry container. Make a batch using ½ cup of
the mix to serve as a dessert. Serve with fruit sauce or
whipped topping, or use to make rice pudding.
FOR MIX
1 cup Truvia Sweet Complete Granulated
stevia
1 cup cornstarch
¾ cup nonfat dry milk powder
½ teaspoon sea salt
2 teaspoons vanilla powder
FOR VANILLA PUDDING
2 cups whole milk
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the stevia, cornstarch, milk powder,
salt, and vanilla powder. Transfer to an airtight container with a lid.
Store in a cool, dry place for up to 1 month, or in the freezer for up to 3
months.
2. Add 2 cups whole milk to a saucepan and whisk in ½ cup pudding mix
until thoroughly dissolved. Bring the milk mixture to a boil over
medium-high heat.
3. Use an instant-read or candy thermometer to check the temperature.
Once it reaches 203ºF, reduce the heat and simmer, stirring constantly,
until the pudding thickens, about 5 minutes. The pudding should coat
the back of a spoon. If it is not thickening enough, add more mix as
needed.
4. Transfer the pudding to a large glass bowl and allow to cool for 10
minutes. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly on the surface to keep
it from forming a skin. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
Top with whipped coconut topping (see Tip, here), if desired. Store in
the fridge for up to 48 hours (I do not recommend freezing this.)

Homemade Chocolate Pudding
SERVINGS: 20 (YIELD: 5 ½-CUP BATCHES DRY MIX; 1 BATCH SERVES 4) | IDDSI
LEVEL
This homemade chocolate pudding mix is better than
anything off the shelf. It is made with a flavorful top-quality
cocoa powder and vanilla powder. Good cocoa powder
means non–Dutch process when making puddings. Natural
food stores carry organic brands. Ghirardelli is a good brand
available in supermarkets. This is easier than melting
chocolate to make pudding.
FOR MIX
1¼ cups Truvia Sweet Complete
Confectioners stevia
1¼ cup cornstarch
1 cup nonfat milk powder
½ cup good cocoa powder, non–Dutch
process
½ teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon vanilla powder
½ teaspoon espresso powder (optional*
)
FOR CHOCOLATE PUDDING
2 cups whole milk
2 tablespoons sugar-free chocolate
syrup
Adding espresso powder brings out the chocolate flavor. Another method: While bringing
the milk to a boil, add 1 teaspoon freshly brewed coffee.
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the stevia, cornstarch, milk powder,
cocoa powder, salt, vanilla powder, and espresso powder (if using).
Transfer the pudding mix to an airtight container with a lid. Store in a
cool, dry place for up to 1 month, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
2. Add 2 cups whole milk to a saucepan and whisk in ½ cup pudding mix
until thoroughly dissolved. Add the sugar-free chocolate syrup. Bring
the milk mixture to a boil over medium-high heat.
3. Use an instant-read or candy thermometer to check the temperature.
Once it reaches 203ºF, reduce the heat and simmer, stirring constantly,
until the pudding thickens, about 5 minutes. The pudding should coat
the back of a spoon. If it is not thickening enough, add more mix as
needed.
4. Transfer the pudding to a large glass bowl and allow to cool for 10
minutes. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly on the surface to keep
it from forming a skin. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
Top with whipped coconut topping (see Tip, here), if desired. Store in
the fridge for up to 48 hours (I do not recommend freezing this.)

Cheesecake Puree
SERVINGS: 1 | IDDSI LEVELS
Great desserts are a necessity for the dysphagia patient—
they add calories and nutrition to the diet. This is an easy
recipe that uses a good store-bought cheesecake. You can cut
one serving of cheesecake from a family dessert, or many
bakery departments in supermarkets sell single servings of
cheesecake. This cheesecake is especially delicious with a
cherry fruit sauce (see Blueberry Sauce, here, and make it
with cherries instead).
1 slice cheesecake
1 tablespoon milk, plus more as needed
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
Fruit sauce (see Blueberry Sauce, here),
optional
1. Scrape the cheesecake filling off the crust and put the filling in a food
processor or blender. Add the milk and blend until smooth, adding more
milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed to get a pudding consistency.
Scrape the pureed filling into a small bowl and set aside.
2. Add the crust to the food processor or blender. Add 1 tablespoon very
hot water. Pulse the crust until it liquefies. Add 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
and puree until all cracker grains have disappeared and you have a
smooth puree.
3. Test as you go and at time of serving to see if a thickening agent,
thickened sauce, or thickened stock is needed; use IDDSI Testing
Methods (iddsi.org) to help achieve the desired IDDSI level. See here.
4. To serve, spoon the crust into a glass serving bowl. Top with the
cheesecake filling and fruit sauce, if using. This is best consumed the
day it is made.

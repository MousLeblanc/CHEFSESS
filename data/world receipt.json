 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more if needed  1/3 cup sherry
 1 thin slice of fresh ginger root
 1 teaspoon soy sauce

to coat well, and marinate for at least 30 minutes in refrigerator.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, and
stir in the ginger and garlic. Let them sizzle in the hot oil for about 1 minute

INGREDIENTS
 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
 2/3 cup dark brown sugar
 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
 1 pound beef flank steak, sliced 1/4 inch thick on the diagonal
 1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
 1/4 cup cornstarch
 1/2 cup soy sauce
 1 cup vegetable oil for frying
 1/2 cup water
 2 bunches green onions, cut in 2-inch length
DIRECTIONS
1. Heat 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and
cook and stir the garlic and ginger until they release their fragrance, about
30 seconds. Pour in the soy sauce, water, and brown sugar. Raise the heat to
medium-high, and stir 4 minutes, until the sugar has dissolved and the sauce
boils and slightly thickens. Remove sauce from the heat, and set aside.
2. Place the sliced beef into a bowl, and stir the cornstarch into the beef,
coating it thoroughly. Allow the beef and cornstarch to sit until most of the
juices from the meat have been absorbed by the cornstarch, about 10
minutes.
3. Heat the vegetable oil in a deep-sided skillet or wok to 375 degrees F
(190 degrees C).
4. Shake excess cornstarch from the beef slices, and drop them into the hot
oil, a few at a time. Stir briefly, and fry until the edges become crisp and
start to brown, about 2 minutes. Remove the beef from the oil with a large
slotted spoon, and allow to drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.
5. Pour the oil out of the skillet or wok, and return the pan to medium heat.
Return the beef slices to the pan, stir briefly, and pour in the reserved sauce.
Stir once or twice to combine, and add the green onions. Bring the mixture
to a boil, and cook until the onions have softened and turned bright green,
about 2 minutes.

 1 clove garlic
 2 cups chicken broth
 1 pinch salt
 1/4 white onion
 12 corn tortillas
 1 clove garlic
 1/4 cup vegetable oil
 2 teaspoons salt
 1 cup crumbled queso fresco
 1 pound fresh tomatillos, husks removed  1/2 white onion, chopped
 5 serrano peppers
 1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
 1/4 white onion
DIRECTIONS
1. In a saucepan, combine chicken breast with chicken broth, one quarter
onion, a clove of garlic, and 2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil, and then boil
for 20 minutes. Reserve broth, set chicken aside to cool, and discard onion
and garlic. When cool enough to handle, shred chicken with your hands.
2. Place tomatillos and serrano chiles in a pot with water, enough to cover
them. Bring to boil, and continue boiling until tomatillos turn a different
shade of green (from bright green to a dull, army green). Strain tomatillos
and chiles, and place in a blender with another quarter piece of onion, 1
clove garlic, and a pinch of salt. Pour in reserved chicken broth, so that
liquid just covers the veggies in the blender by about an inch. Blend all
ingredients until they are completely pureed. Pour salsa in a medium
saucepan, and bring to a low boil.
3. Pour oil in a frying pan, and allow to get very hot. Slightly fry tortillas
one by one in hot oil, setting each on a paper towel afterwards to soak some
of the oil. Finally, dip slightly fried tortillas in lowboiling green salsa, until
tortillas become soft again. Place on plates, 3 per person.
4. Fill or top tortillas with shredded chicken, then extra green sauce. Top
with crumbled cheese, chopped onion, and chopped cilantro.

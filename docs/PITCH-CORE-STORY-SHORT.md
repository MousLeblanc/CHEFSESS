## **Title:** Pre-flight — Find Your Core Story

*3 quick lines to warm up before the Masterclass.*

**→ Human words, no overthinking.**

---

## **1) Problem (1 sentence)**

> **"Nursing home groups managing 70+ facilities struggle daily with menu planning that must respect individual resident allergies, AFSCA regulations, food cost per site, legal meal sample retention, and centralized management — all while chefs are limited to 3 hours of work per day."**

---

## **2) Proof (1 figure + source)**

> **"Built Chef SES after 1 year as a chef at Vulpia Group (70+ facilities, 4000+ residents) — they now want to acquire the application after seeing it solve every operational challenge I observed: resident profiles, AFSCA compliance, food cost tracking, meal sample retention, centralized menu planning, and integrated supplier network with dedicated supplier dashboards."**

---

## **3) CTA (one next action)**

> **"I'm at a strategic crossroads: Vulpia Group wants to acquire Chef SES, but I see massive potential to scale across all collective catering. I'd like your advice on whether to sell now or scale — let's discuss the best path forward."**

**Alternative CTAs:**
- **For investors**: "Vulpia wants to acquire, but I see potential to scale across schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and corporate cafeterias. Should I sell or raise to scale?"

## 📝 **Alternative Versions**

### **Version A: More Personal**

**Problem:**
> "I worked as a chef at Vulpia Group and watched managers waste hours every day manually creating menus that must comply with strict regulations, individual resident needs, and budget constraints across 70+ facilities — while suppliers operated in silos with no real-time coordination."

**Proof:**
> "Vulpia Group — where I documented these challenges for 1 year — requested exclusivity, then offered to acquire Chef SES after seeing it address every constraint: AFSCA compliance, food cost per site, meal sample retention, centralized menu management, and seamless supplier integration with real-time order tracking."

**CTA:**
> "Book a 20-min demo to see how Chef SES handles the same operational challenges in your facilities."

---

### **Version B: More Direct**

**Problem:**
> "Collective catering groups (schools, hospitals, nursing homes, corporate cafeterias) waste 4-6 hours per week on manual menu planning that must handle allergies, regulatory compliance, food cost tracking, and centralized management — while suppliers coordinate through fragmented systems."

**Proof:**
> "1 year as a chef at Vulpia Group (70+ facilities, 4000+ residents) → built Chef SES to solve observed problems including supplier coordination → Vulpia now wants to acquire it."

**CTA:**
> "Join our pilot program — see how Chef SES automates menu planning with full regulatory compliance."

---

### **Version C: Validation-Focused**

**Problem:**
> "Nursing home chefs spend hours daily creating menus that must respect individual allergies, AFSCA regulations, food cost constraints, and legal meal sample requirements — problems I witnessed firsthand."

**Proof:**
> "Vulpia Group (70+ facilities, 4000+ residents) wants to acquire Chef SES — the platform I built after working there as a chef and documenting every operational challenge."

**CTA:**
> "Let's discuss how Chef SES can solve your menu planning challenges — I'll show you the platform with real examples."

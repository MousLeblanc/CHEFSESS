2. Cream Cheese Hamantaschen
Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 stick (1/2 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into bits
4 ounces (1/2 cup) cream cheese, cut into bits
1 large egg yolk
1 teaspoon vanilla
2/3 cup filling such as apricot jam, Date Orange Filling , Apple
Raisin Filling , prune lekvar, or poppy-seed filling
Direction
In a food processor/bowl with a pastry blender, pulse/blend salt,
sugar and flour to combine. Add cream cheese and butter,
pulsing/blending until it looks like coarse crumbs. Mix vanilla
and yolk in a small bowl. Add into flour mixture,
pulsing/blending until it starts to come together without
overmixing. Bring dough to a ball. Flatten it to a disk. Chill
dough for a minimum of 1 hour up to 2 days, wrapped in plastic
wrap.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Halve the dough. Knead half of the dough on a lightly floured
cool surface (keep the other half wrapped up and chilled) 2-3
times to make the dough less crumble. Roll it out to 1/4-in
thick. Cut out as many rounds as you can with a 3-in. cutter.
Roll scraps again and cut more rounds out. In the middle of
every round, put 1 tsp. filling. Fold edges up to make triangular
cookies that look like a tricornered hat. Pinch corners together
and leave the filling exposed. Tightly pinch the dough enough
so the seams aren ’ t seen and the sides are taut enough to avoid
leaking the filling from the cookies while they bake.
In the middle of the oven, bake hamantaschen for 20 minutes or
until pale golden. Cool them for 5 minutes on a baking sheet.
Transfer to racks. Completely cool. Make more with the leftover
dough and filling with the same method. These should be kept
at room temperature in an airtight container for 5 days.

3. Yeasted Blinis
Ingredients
1 1/4-ounce envelope active dry yeast
1/2 cup plus 2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons plus 3 tablespoons sugar
2 large eggs, separated
2 1/2 cups half-and-half, room temperature
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted, plus more, chilled,
for skillet
2 teaspoons kosher salt
Direction
In a big bowl, combine 1 cup of water, 2 tsp. of sugar, 1/2 cup
of flour and yeast, then cover and allow to sit for about half an
hour in a warm area until whole surface is foamy and puffed in
places. If this does not happen, that means your yeast is past its
prime, so begin again with a fresh package.
Put into the mixture the leftover 3 tbsp. of sugar, leftover 2 1/3
cups of flour, salt, melted butter, half-and-half and egg yolks,
then whisk together until smooth. Place a cover on batter and
allow to sit in warm place for 3 to 4 hours, until nearly tripled in
volume. If you want to make it in advance, cover and refrigerate
for 8 to 12 hours, then bring to room temperature prior to
proceeding.
In a medium bowl, whisk egg whites until it holds soft peaks,
then fold into the batter. In a big nonstick skillet, melt
approximately 1/2 tbsp. of butter on moderate heat, then scoop
in batter by heaping tablespoonfuls to form 2-in. blinis. Cook
for about 3 minutes, until bubbles appear on top and bottoms
turn golden brown. Turn batter over and cook for about 3
minutes, until the other sides turn golden brown. Move blinis to
wire racks. Repeat the same process with leftover batter while
wiping out skillet and putting in more butter as necessary.

5. Grilled Basque Wings
Ingredients
3 large garlic cloves, chopped
8 tablespoons lemon juice (about 2 lemons)
2 tablespoons virgin olive oil
5 to 15 dashes of Tabasco sauce, depending on your taste
3 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs (whatever you've got: basil,
parsley, sage, thyme, oregano, or rosemary)
20 chicken wings (you can usually get a pack of wings at the
market very cheap)
Salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste
Direction
Mix all the ingredients in a large serving bowl except for the
chicken wings.
The wing has 2 joints. Separate the wing into 3 portions by
cutting it through both joints. You can toss out the wing tip
since you can ’ t use it here or freeze it and add it to your next
stock dish to make it amazing.
Season the wing pieces with salt and pepper to taste. Whip the
wing pieces onto the medium-hot grill. Grill them for 5 minutes,
turning sometimes until golden brown. Grab a bite on the wing
piece to know it its done.
Once the wings are cooked through, toss them into a bowl with
the dressing. Cover the wings thoroughly with the dressing to
coat. Spread them on a platter and enjoy them with a cold beer.
Tip: You probably want to use the cleaver in separating the
chicken wings. But you can practice using the sharp knife since
you can find its weak spot in the joint easily.

10. Beef And Potato Pasties
Ingredients
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface
2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more
10 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided, plus more for
serving
3/4 pound boneless chuck steak, cut into 1/2" cubes
1 medium russet potato, peeled, cut into 1/2" cubes (about 1 1/2
cups)
1/2 medium onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 large egg
Ketchup (for serving; optional)
Direction
In a big bowl, combine 1 teaspoon salt and 2 1/2 cups of flour.
Slice 10 tablespoon of butter into cubes (it does not need to be
specifically cold, just firm enough to slice into portions). Into
the flour, work the butter using your fingertips till mixture looks
much like breadcrumbs. Put 3/4 cup of boiling water on top and
stir using wooden spoon. Using your hands, knead till dough
just begins to form.
Transfer to a clean work area and knead for 20 seconds till
dough forms; roll into a round. Split into quarters, form into
circles, and refrigerate till ready to use.
Preheat an oven to 375 ° F. In one big bowl, combine 1
teaspoon salt, pepper, onion, potato and beef.
On a lightly floured work area, unroll every circle to a 9-inch
diameter round. Over 1 half of each round, place a heaping 3/4
cup filling, keeping a one-inch margin between edge of round
and the filling. Slice leftover 1/2 tablespoons of butter into 4
portions; put on every mound of filling. Drag bottom half of
dough on top of filling; flute using your fingers to enclose. Or,
enclose with a fork.
In small bowl, whip a pinch of salt and egg. Brush egg wash on
every pasty with pastry brush. Make a couple small cuts in
pasty top. Turn onto a rimmed baking sheet lined with
parchment and bake for 45 minutes to an hour till bubbling and

11. Cincinnati Chili
Ingredients
8 ounces whole-wheat spaghetti
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound lean (90% or leaner) ground beef
1 medium onion, diced
2 tablespoons chili powder
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes, preferably fire-roasted
1 14-ounce can reduced-sodium beef broth

instructions. Strain the pasta and put aside.
While pasta is cooking, heat up the oil in a big frypan upon a
medium-high heat and add in cinnamon, chili powder, onions,
and beef. Cook this up while stirring, making sure to break up
any lumps using a spoon, until the onions start getting soft, 5
minutes. Stir in the broth and tomatoes, then allow the chili to
boil. Drop the heat to a brisk simmer and cook, mixing
regularly, up till the sauce becomes thick, 15 minutes or so.

completely, for another minute. Serve this chili dish up over the

12. Kansas City Sweet And Smoky Ribs
Ingredients
4 racks of spareribs (4 to 6 pounds total)
6 cups apple cider, plus additional for spraying the ribs
2 whole lemons (optional), halved
2/3 cup Basic Barbecue Rub or your favorite commercial brand
3 cups of your favorite homemade barbecue sauce or your
favorite commercial brand
3 cups wood chips (preferably hickory), soaked for 1 hour in
apple cider to cover, then drained; spray bottle; rib rack
(optional)
Direction
Trim each rib rack or ask a butcher to do this.
In a big nonreactive roasting pan, put ribs; put cider on ribs.
Squeeze juice from lemons on ribs, catching seeds with fingers.
Flip ribs a few times to coat with marinade all over. Marinade
ribs, covered, turning a few times, for 4-6 hours in the fridge.
Drain ribs; use paper towels to blot dry. Sprinkle 1/2 cub rub on
both rib sides, using your fingers to pat onto meat. Stand ribs,
covered, for 1-2 hours in the fridge.
Prep grill for indirect grilling; preheat to medium. Put big drip
pan in middle if using charcoal grill. Put all wood whips into
smoker box/smoker pouch if using gas grill; preheat to high till
you see smoker. Lower heat to medium.
When you want to cook, toss 1 cup wood chips on coals if using
charcoal; put ribs, away from heat, in middle of hot grate. Cover
grill; cook ribs for 2-3 hours. Spray apple cider on ribs after 30
minutes; spray every half hour till you want to brush with sauce.
You ’ ll need 1/2 cup of wood chips and 12 fresh coals on each
side after each hour if using charcoal grill.
20 minutes before ribs are done, brush 1 cup sauce on ribs
lightly. Meat will get tender enough so your fingers can tear
them apart and meat will shrink back from bones around 1/4-in.,
when ribs are cooked fully. Don ’ t overcook; ribs should still
have some chew. Wrap in aluminum foil at final hour of
cooking if ribs begin to dry out.
Put ribs onto platter/plates. Sprinkle leftover rub on ribs; brush
barbecue sauce lightly. Rest ribs for several minutes; serve with
leftover barbecue sauce alongside.
Smoker option: Smoke ribs in smoker at 225 ° F for 4-5 hours.
You can use baby back ribs for this recipe too; allow 2-3 hours
for cooking in smoker or 1-1 1/2 hours for the indirect grilling.

41. Persian Steamed White Rice (Chelo)
Ingredients
5 cups basmati rice, checked and rinsed
12 cups water
1/2 cup canola oil
3 tablespoons salt
1/4-inch canola oil poured into the bottom of the saucepan
2 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon turmeric or powdered saffron (optional, for a more
authentic flavor)
Direction
Cooking the rice
1. Add 12 cups of water (at least 6 quarts) into a large nonstick
saucepan. Then add salt and oil. Cover the pan and heat to a
brisk boil on high heat.
2. Pour in rice and continue to cook on medium to high heat
while stirring often.
3. When 3-5 minutes elapse, scoop some grains from water
using a slotted spoon. Cut 1 grain in half to ensure it ’ s "al
dente". Switch the heat off and drain the rice into a colander. Set
aside.
To steam and prepare tadig
1. Over medium heat, put back the empty 6-quart saucepan onto
stovetop. Pour in 2 tablespoons of water and 1/4-inch of canola
oil. Stir in turmeric and/or saffron powder. Combine together.
2. Pour in the drained rice and form it into a pyramid. Cover pot
and let to cook for about 5 to 7 minutes until the rice starts to
steam.
3. Remove cover and put two paper towels (one over the other)
on top of rice. The ends should extend outside pot. Tightly
replace the lid.
4. Decrease the heat to low and let to simmer while covered for
45 minutes. Switch the heat off and then tilt the lid until when
you ’ re ready to serve.
5. Spoon rice from the pot with a wide spatula and ensure you
don ’ t disturb the crust (tadig) that was formed at the pot ’ s
bottom. Transfer rice on a flat serving platter and mound it to
form a pyramid. Flip out the tadig onto a flat serving platter by
inverting pot just like you wouldinvert a cake pan or chop into
pieces and then serve around rice.
Alternative garnish: Saffron Rice
1. To prepare saffron water, combine together 1/4 cup of hot
water and 1 teaspoon of crushed saffron threads. Then steep for
a several minutes until water turns yellow.
2. Combine the saffron water together with the steamed white
rice. Make designs on the Chelo with the intensely yellow rice.
Reheating this rice: Into a large pot, add half cup of water
combined with 1/4 cup of canola oil onto the pyramid. Feel free
to freeze the rice without stirring it until defrosted completely.
You may cook it, freeze and then steam later it as it defrosts.
Note: When preparing Chelo, ensure you have a colander set in
your sink to drain rice so as to prevent overcooking. In addition,
when steaming rice by putting paper towels in between the pot
and the lid, ensure they ’ re safely away from the heat source.
Once the rice is steamed, tilt the lid to let the extra steam escape
to prevent crunchy bottom from becoming soggy.

42. Quince Stew (Chorosht'e Be)
Ingredients
1 large onion, chopped
3 garlic cloves, pressed
1/4 cup olive oil
2 pounds stew meat
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon pepper
3 cups water
1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste
2 quinces, do not peel; just slice like an apple (make sure to
remove the entire core)
1/4 cup lime or lemon juice or the juice of 3 limes
3/4 cup pitted prunes
2 potatoes, peeled and cut into medium dice
Direction
Preparation: 1. Saut é onion and garlic in olive oil in a 6-quart
saucepan until the onion starts to become transparent, 1 minute.
Add meat and cover to cook until there is no red, stir
occasionally. Add salt and pepper to taste.
2. Add water, potatoes, tomato paste, lime juice, prunes and
quince. Let it simmer and cover for 1 hour stir it occasionally
until the meat is tender.
3. It is best when served hot!
Tricks of the trade: Remove the whole core from the fruit, any
remainder will cook forming a hard rock layer on the fruit.
Quinces are actually hard to find, make sure to buy some and
freeze them. Slice them and put in separate bags so you can use
them as needed. Either Lamb or veal are also best serve with
this recipe, but it can also turn into vegetarian-friendly by using
seitan instead.
By the way don't freeze this one, unlike other Persian stews
because potatoes don't like the freezer!

47. Octopus And Ceci Bean Zuppa With
Escarole, Garlic, And Chiles
Ingredients
1/2 cup dried ceci beans (chickpeas)
Kosher salt
2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for finishing
6 cloves garlic, smashed with the side of a knife
Rind of 1/2 lemon, zested into strips using a vegetable peeler
2 bay leaves
1 (3- to 4-pound) octopus, defrosted, if frozen, and rinsed
1 head escarole (about 12 ounces), cored
3 celery stalks, thinly sliced
3 to 4 Calabrian chiles, stemmed and minced
Direction
Pick over and remove any pebbles and broken pieces from the
beans. Rinse the beans thoroughly. Soak beans in a bowl
covering with a generous amount of water, fully submerging the
beans, for 2 hours or up to overnight.
Drain and transfer the beans to a pot. Fill pot with water,
covering the beans by 2 inches. Over high heat, bring the beans
to a boil. Adjust the heat and cook at a slow simmer, uncovered,
until the beans are tender, or around 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add 1
teaspoon of salt to season, remove from the heat. Allow to cool
completely. In a storage container, transfer the beans and its
liquid. Refrigerate overnight. Drain the beans and reserve the
liquid, there should be around 1 to 2 cups of liquid, this recipe
requires 2 cups liquid. If the liquid doesn ’ t reach 2 cups, add
enough water until it reaches 2 cups.
Over medium heat, heat 1/3 cup of olive oil in a large, heavybottomed pot. Stir in 2 teaspoons of kosher salt, 1 bay leaf, the
strips of lemon zest, and 3 garlic cloves. Cook while mixing
occasionally until garlic starts to soften, or around 3 minutes.
Stir in octopus to coat in oil. Weight octopus down with a lid or
a plate to prevent it from starting to float once it releases the
water. Cover the pot and reset the heat to bring to a gentle
simmer. The octopus will create its own braising liquid when
they slowly begin releasing water.
Cook, checking how much braising liquid is in the pot after
around 30 minutes cooking. If the liquid is only 1 cup or less
(this will not occur if you are cooking a whole uncooked
octopus), pour in 1 cup of water. Check its tenderness then keep
cooking until octopus is almost completely tender, or another 30
to 50 minutes. The octopus will decrease in size drastically.
Remove from the heat and allow to cool in the pot of braising
liquid for 1 hour.
In the meantime, fill a large pot with salted water and bring to a
boil. Put in escarole and cook until tender, or around 3 minutes.
Drain thoroughly. Once cool enough to handle, chop leaves
coarsely. Set aside.
Put a colander into a large bowl. After cooling the octopus for 1
hour, place it to the colander. Using a fine-mesh strainer, strain
the braising liquid to a measuring pitcher. If there is any extra
liquid drained from the octopus, transfer it to the bowl to the
braising liquid. For the zuppa, 1 cup of braising liquid is
required. Wash the pot used to cook the octopus quickly and
return to the stove.
Place the octopus on a large cutting board and slice into 1/4 inch
thick pieces, starting from the thickest point of the tentacle and
increasing the thickness of the slices as the tentacle becomes
narrower. Slice head in half and cut into 1/4 inch strips. Set
aside.
In the cleaned pot, heat 1/3 cup of olive oil over medium heat to
prepare the zuppa. Add the remaining bay leaf, chiles, celery,
and remaining 3 garlic cloves. Stir thoroughly. Stir in the
reserved cooking liquid and beans, then the reserved braising
liquid and octopus. Once hot, taste and season with salt, as
needed. Stir in escarole. Simmer for a few minutes longer.
In warm bowls, ladle the soup and drizzle each serving with
olive oil. Serve right away.

2 1/2 tbsp Sichuan chilli bean paste
2 tsp finely chopped ginger
4 tsp finely chopped garlic
3/4 cup (200ml) chicken stock
1 tsp light soy sauce, to taste
2 tsp potato flour dissolved in 1 1/2 tbsp cold water
3-4 tbsp finely sliced spring onion greens
1 tsp sesame oil
Direction
Make 3 diagonal, even cuts in the thickest part of each fish side
to let sauce penetrate. Rub a bit of salt inside and out. Rub
Shaoxing wine in the belly cavity. Put aside for 10-15 minutes.
Drain off any liquid. Pat dry. Rub a bit more salt on both sides
of the skin to avoid sticking.
In a seasoned wok, put 1/2 cup/100ml oil on high heat. When
hot, slide fish in. Fry on both sides until a bit golden yet not
cooked through. Carefully turn fish and tilt it to make oil touch
all the skin. Pour oil off into a heatproof container. Slide fish on
a plate.
If needed, clean wok. Reheat wok on high heat. Put 2-3 tbsp.
oil. Lower heat to medium. Add chili bean paste. Stir fry until it
smells delicious and oil is red. Add garlic and ginger, stir fry
until fragrant. Pour stock in; boil. Slide fish in. Cook for around
5 minutes or more, season using soy sauce to taste.
Continuously spoon sauce on fish and tip wok to cook the
whole fish. Turn it halfway if you ’ re using a big fish. With a
fish slice and wok scoop, lift fish carefully from sauce. Put it
onto a serving dish.
Increase heat. Mix potato flour mixture. Add enough to make
the sauce thicken to a clingy, rich consistency. Do it in stages to
prevent over-thickening. Mix in spring onion. Turn off heat.
Mix in sesame oil. Ladle sauce on fish.
For carp: For a 1 1/2-1 3/4-lb. carp, do the same recipe above
but increase quantities to 4 tbsp. spring onion greens, 1 cup/250
ml stock, 1 tbsp. ginger, 1 tbsp. garlic, 3 1/2 tbsp. chili bean
paste and 2 tbsp. Shaoxing wine. Cover wok as you simmer to
cook the thicker fish parts, opening lid occasionally to baste
with sauce.

Ingredients
7 Yukon Gold potatoes
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
Direction
Bring cold water with unpeeled potatoes to a boil. Once
potatoes are nearly soft, drain off water and let cool. Make sure

will be tough. Remove potato skins and then mash. Measure 4
cups of mashed potatoes, put to one side and let them cool.
Preheat an electric skillet or a cast iron to medium heat. Mix
sugar and butter into 4 cups mashed potatoes. Add
approximately 1 cup of flour and stir it into the potatoes. Adjust
the amount of flour little by little depending on how moist the
mashed potatoes are, the less flour used, the better, but make
sure the final result is not sticky.
Sprinkle some flour to coat your rolling pin and pastry board.
Shape lefse dough into a ball that has the size of a small apple
and roll it out evenly to make a very thin circle. The lefse circle
should be as thin as a crepe, and if you are not careful, it will
tear easily.
Heat a frying pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook both
sides of the lefse on the skillet, 1 to 3 minutes for each side until

1 onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

bubbles are forming around the edges; pour the heated milk
over the bread cubes. Give the mixture a little mix just to coat
the bread cubes. Allow the bread cubes to soak in the heated
milk for 15 minutes.
While the bread cubes are soaking in the milk, in a skillet, let
the butter heat up over medium heat setting until melted. Put in
the onions and saut é it in melted butter until it has softened.
Add in the parsley and give it a mix, then remove the skillet
away from the heat. Put the saut é ed onion mixture, salt,
pepper and eggs into the soaked bread mixture and mix.
Squeeze the dough mixture with your hands through your
fingers until you get a sticky and smooth dough.
Fill a big pot with at least 3- or 4-inch-deep water and a little bit
of salt and let it boil. Make a trial dumpling once the water
started boiling, just pat a portion of the dough mixture and cup
it in between your wet hands until it is about the same size as a
small tangerine or orange. Slowly put the trial dumpling into the
boiling water. The dough is still too wet if the trial dumpling
breaks apart in the boiling water. In case the dough is still too
wet, add some bread crumbs into the remaining dumpling
dough mixture and mix.
Shape the rest of the dough mixture into big pieces of
dumplings then drop each dumpling gently into the boiling
water. Let the water simmer for 20 minutes then use a big
slotted spoon to transfer the cooked dumplings onto a serving
plate. The deliciously cooked dumplings should have a spongelike and soft texture.

Stir 2 cups of sugar together with evaporated milk on low heat
in a saucepan. Cook and stir from time to time on low heat for
25 minutes until the mixture thickens enough for you to see the
bottom of the pan when stirring.
Slowly pour in the sweetened condensed milk in a very thin
stream and stir. Add egg yolks with a small amount of the hot
milk mixture, then while rapidly stirring, return into the
saucepan slowly in a thin stream. Combine in the vanilla. Pass
the mixture through a strainer or a sieve into individual
heatproof custard cups or ramekins. Then put aside.
Stir water together with a cup of sugar in another saucepan. Boil
and cook until the mixture a thin brittle thread forms from
spinning the spoon. Retrieve from the heat. Use an electric
mixer to whip the egg whites in a large bowl until it holds a stiff
peak. While whipping at low speed, sprinkle in the sugar syrup
until they are incorporated completely. Combine at medium
speed until the meringue becomes cold to avoid separating.
Scoop on the cups of custard to serve, then lightly dust top with
ground cinnamon.

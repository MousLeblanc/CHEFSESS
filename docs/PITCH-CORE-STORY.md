# 🎯 Chef SES - Core Story Pitch (Pre-flight)

## **Title:** Pre-flight — Find Your Core Story (10 min)

*3 quick lines to warm up before the Masterclass.*

**→ Human words, no overthinking.**

---

## **1) Problem (1 sentence)**

*What real pain do you solve — for whom?*

💬 *Tip: focus on the user's headache, not your solution.*

> **"Collective catering groups — schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and corporate cafeterias — waste hours daily manually creating menus that must respect individual allergies, strict regulations (AFSCA), food cost per site, legal meal sample retention, and centralized management across multiple facilities — all while coordinating with suppliers through fragmented emails and phone calls."**

**Alternative shorter version:**
> **"Large collective catering groups (schools, hospitals, nursing homes, corporate cafeterias) struggle with complex menu planning that must comply with strict regulations, individual dietary needs, and budget constraints across multiple sites — while suppliers operate in silos with separate systems, creating coordination inefficiencies."**

---

## **2) Proof (1 figure + source)**

*One concrete fact that supports your value.*

💡 *Early-stage Proof options:*

> **"Built Chef SES after 1 year as a chef at Vulpia Group (70+ facilities, 4000+ residents) — they now want to acquire the application after seeing it solve every operational challenge I observed internally: resident profile management, AFSCA compliance, food cost tracking, meal sample retention, centralized menu planning, and seamless supplier integration with dedicated supplier dashboards."**

**Alternative with more specific validation:**
> **"Vulpia Group — where I worked as a chef for 1 year managing 70+ facilities and 4000+ residents — requested exclusivity, then offered to acquire Chef SES after seeing it address all the constraints I documented: AFSCA compliance, food cost per site, meal sample retention, centralized menu management, and integrated supplier network with real-time order tracking."**

**Key proof elements:**
- ✅ **Traction signal**: Vulpia Group wants to acquire (exclusivity → acquisition offer)
- ✅ **User insight**: Built from 1 year of internal observation
- ✅ **Expert validation**: Endorsed by actual user (Vulpia Group)
- ✅ **Product validation**: Solves real problems observed in the field

## **3) CTA (one next action)**

*What's the one next action you want from your audience?*

💬 *E.g., book a 20-min call, join the pilot, follow-up test.*

> **"I'm at a strategic crossroads: Vulpia Group wants to acquire Chef SES, but I'm also seeing strong demand from other collective catering groups. I'd like your advice on whether to sell now or scale — let's discuss the best path forward."**

**Alternative CTAs based on audience:**

**For investors/advisors:**
> "Vulpia Group has offered to acquire Chef SES, but I see massive potential to scale across all collective catering (schools, hospitals, nursing homes, corporate cafeterias). I'd like to discuss whether to sell now or raise funding to scale — what's your take?"

**For potential clients:**
> "Let's schedule a 20-minute call to show you how Chef SES can solve the same challenges in your facilities — I'll demonstrate with real examples from Vulpia Group's use case."

## 📖 **The Full Story (Context for deeper conversations)**

### **The Origin Story**

> "I spent 1 year as a chef at Vulpia Group, one of Belgium's largest nursing home operators with 70+ facilities and 4000+ residents. During that time, I observed firsthand the daily operational nightmares that chefs and managers face:
>
> - **Complex resident profiles**: Each resident has unique allergies, dietary restrictions, medical conditions, and texture requirements
> - **AFSCA compliance**: Strict food safety regulations requiring meticulous documentation
> - **Meal sample retention**: Legal requirement to keep food samples in case of resident death
> - **Food cost management**: Each facility must track costs independently while the group needs centralized visibility
> - **Menu centralization**: The group wanted to standardize menus across sites while respecting individual needs
> - **Time constraints**: Chefs limited to 3 hours of work per day, yet expected to manage all of this
>
> I was fired because I insisted on buying organic ingredients and worked more than the 3 hours they imposed — but that experience gave me the insight to build Chef SES.
>
> Today, Vulpia Group wants to acquire the application because it solves every single problem I documented during my time there."

### **Why This Story Works**

1. **Authenticity**: Real experience, not theoretical
2. **Credibility**: Built by someone who lived the problem
3. **Validation**: The same company that fired you now wants to buy your solution
4. **Specificity**: Concrete details (AFSCA, meal samples, 3-hour constraint)
5. **Emotional connection**: Personal journey from problem to solution

## 🎯 **Refined Pitch Versions**

### **Version 1: Problem-Focused (30 seconds)**

> "I worked as a chef at Vulpia Group managing 70+ nursing homes and 4000+ residents.

I built Chef SES to solve these exact problems. Vulpia Group now wants to acquire it, but I'm evaluating whether to sell or scale across all collective catering."

### **Version 2: Solution-Focused (30 seconds)**

> "Chef SES is the platform I built after working as a chef at Vulpia Group. It automates menu planning for all collective catering — schools, hospitals, nursing homes, corporate cafeterias — handling allergies, AFSCA compliance, food cost tracking, centralized management, and supplier integration. Vulpia Group has offered to acquire it, but I see potential to scale across the entire market."

### **Version 3: Validation-Focused (30 seconds)**

> "Vulpia Group, where I worked as a chef for 1 year, wants to acquire Chef SES. I built it to solve the exact operational challenges I observed: complex resident profiles, AFSCA compliance, food cost per site, meal sample retention, centralized menu management, and supplier coordination. The platform addresses every constraint I documented. Now I'm at a crossroads: sell to Vulpia or scale across all collective catering?"

## 💼 **Strategic Decision Framework: Sell vs. Scale**

### **Option 1: Sell to Vulpia Group**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Immediate exit and financial return
- ✅ Validation that the solution works
- ✅ Lower risk (no need to build sales/marketing)
- ✅ Vulpia can scale it within their network

**Cons:**
- ❌ Limited to one buyer's vision
- ❌ May not reach full market potential
- ❌ Lose control over product direction
- ❌ Smaller total addressable market (just Vulpia's facilities)

**When to sell:**
- If the offer is strong and you want to move on
- If you lack resources to scale
- If you prefer a quick exit over long-term growth

### **Option 2: Scale Across Market**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Massive market opportunity (all collective catering + suppliers)
- ✅ Multiple revenue streams (subscriptions, supplier fees)
- ✅ Control over product direction
- ✅ Potential for much larger exit later
- ✅ Impact on entire industry

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires funding for sales/marketing
- ❌ Higher risk (need to prove market fit beyond Vulpia)
- ❌ Longer timeline to profitability
- ❌ Need to build team and operations

**When to scale:**
- If you believe in the full market potential
- If you can raise funding or bootstrap
- If you want to build a larger company
- If you see strong demand from other groups

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**

**Consider:**
- Sell to Vulpia but retain rights to other markets
- License the technology to Vulpia while scaling elsewhere
- Partner with Vulpia to co-develop and scale together
- Sell majority stake but keep equity for upside

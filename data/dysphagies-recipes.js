      "Set aside any family servings before pureeing, adding matzo balls, carrots, and parsnips to each serving.",
      "For the puree, add 4 ounces chicken breast per serving to a blender or food processor. Pulse a few times to chop the chicken, add 2 matzo balls, ¼ cup broth, and a few pieces of carrot and parsnip, and blend until smooth, adding additional broth, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed to achieve a smooth puree.",

      "Into the cavity of each bird, place ½ lemon, a sprig of rosemary, and a garlic clove. Rub the outside of the hens with the olive oil, then season with salt and white pepper.",
      "Place the birds on top of the roasting rack, with some room between them to allow air to circulate. Roast for 20 minutes per pound, until the juices run clear when a knife is inserted into the joint between the breast and the thigh, or until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165°F (75°C).",
      "Remove from the oven and transfer the birds to a cutting board or platter to cool.",
      "To make the gravy, remove the rack from the roasting pan. Remove the vegetables, giblets, and bay leaf from the drippings in the pan. In a small bowl, combine the Wondra flour with 2 tablespoons water to make a slurry, and whisk until the mixture is smooth.",
      "Place the roasting pan on the stovetop over medium heat and bring the pan drippings to a simmer. Add the slurry to the pan drippings and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Lower the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. › Tip: If you like liver, you can add the liver to the gravy puree. You can discard the bay leaf and then puree the carrot and onions—I find the celery can become a bit stringy; thicken them to the prescribed IDDSI level [see here], and serve them as a side dish with the hens.",
      "Once the birds have cooled, carve off the breasts and remove the meat from the legs and wings. Divide the meat into servings of 4 to 6 ounces and reserve any servings for family meals, if desired.",

(If you have a smaller squash or if you purchased ¾ pound peeled and cut squash, use all of it here. If you have a larger squash, see Roasted Butternut Squash (here) for what to do with the other half.) › Tip: I use a small Chinese cleaver to cut the butternut squash in half vertically, as it requires muscle power. Insert the tip of the cleaver at the top of the squash and lean firmly as you lower the cleaver down the neck and into the body of the vegetable. Simply leveraging your weight ought to do it. If the peel is difficult to remove when the squash is raw, then remove the skin after roasting, when it is soft.",
      "On the baking sheet, combine the butternut squash cubes with the other vegetables. Drizzle with the olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Roast on the center rack for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, toss the chopped vegetables and drizzle with a few tablespoons of water if they begin to look dry.",

If not pressure cooking, beans will cook faster if they are soaked. If they are not soaked, the cooking time will be longer. Stovetop method: If you have time, soak the beans overnight in water to rehydrate. Then drain and cook as follows. Add the beans and onion to a pot. Cover with about 1 inch of water over the level of the beans. Add herbs and spices: a bay leaf or oregano and parsley for cannellini or chickpeas; cumin for pinto beans.",

      "Make an aluminum foil sling for four 6-ounce (¾ cup) porcelain custard ramekins. For each sling, fold a 12-inch-long piece of aluminum foil into thirds lengthwise. Place under the ramekin and fold the tops together to secure the sling.",
      "This is your device for removing the ramekins from the pressure cooker. Using a ramekin as a stencil, cut four disks from another sheet of foil to cover the top of the custard in each ramekin. Place 1 teaspoon caramel sauce into the bottom of each ramekin. Swirl the ramekin so the caramel covers the bottom.",
      "In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, and maple syrup until smooth. Add the pumpkin puree and spices and whisk until blended thoroughly. Divide the mixture among the ramekins.",
      "Cover the top of each ramekin with a foil disk and place each in its foil sling.",
      "Pressure cooker method: Lower the ramekins into the steamer rack of the pressure cooker. Fill the bottom of the pressure cooker with water, just below the steamer rack. Cook on high pressure for 20 minutes; allow pressure to release naturally. Stovetop method: Alternatively, place a steamer basket in a large pot on the stove, add water to fill just below the base of the basket, and bring the water to a boil. Carefully lower the ramekins into the steaming basket. Lower the heat, cover, and steam until the custard is just set, 30 to 45 minutes.",
      "Once done, remove the lid and transfer the ramekins to a cooling rack to cool completely. Refrigerate for 4 hours before serving.",
      "To serve, gently remove the aluminum foil cover from the custard. Run a knife under warm water and loosen the custard by running the knife around the edge of the ramekin. Using a saucer or a shallow bowl, cover the top of the ramekin and flip it to turn the custard out. The caramel will be on top. Serve immediately, or store, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. (I do not recommend freezing.)",

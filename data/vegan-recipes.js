      "Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly oil a 9- by-5-inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, almond flour, oats, flaxseed, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a medium bowl, mash bananas very well with a fork. Add in melted coconut oil, maple syrup, applesauce, vanilla, and lemon juice. Alternatively, blend bananas and wet ingredients together in a food processor for a smoother result. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix gently. Gently stir in nuts and chocolate chips. Be careful not to overmix as you will create a tough, not tender, bread. Pour the batter into prepared pan and bake for 50 to 55 minutes. You’ll start to really smell the bread when it is close to being done. Bread is done when the edges are nicely browned, the bread is just firm to the touch, and a toothpick or knife inserted into the middle comes out clean. Cool for about 20 minutes. Insert a knife along the edge of the pan and invert onto a cutting board or plate. Let cool another 10 minutes before cutting, or gently slice while warm. Nut  Breakfa Bar"

You want very small pieces, but not the consistency of nut flour. Empty the mixture into a bowl and set aside. Place dates, cranberries, almond butter, and coconut oil in the food processor and process until the dates and cranberries are broken down and everything is combined, but it still has a bit of texture. Add the nuts back into the processor and pulse a few times to combine. Mixture should be moist enough to hold together when pinched. Line an 8-inch square baking pan or casserole with parchment, allowing two ends to hang over the sides of the pan slightly so you can lift the contents out after chilling. Empty contents of food processor into the lined baking pan and firmly press down. Chill in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. Remove from refrigerator, carefully lift out parchment paper, and cut into squares. Serve chilled. Blueberr-Banan an Pralin Frenc Toa Caserl"

      "Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil a 9-inch square casserole dish. To make the praline topping, melt the butter in a small pot over medium heat. Add brown sugar and syrup. Stir and bring to a simmer. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until the sugar is dissolved. Stir in the pecans and turn off the heat. Leave the pot on the stove to keep warm or else the mixture will harden. If the praline mixture hardens, reheat for a few minutes, stirring occasionally. To assemble the French toast casserole, arrange one layer of baguette slices on the bottom of the casserole dish. Top the bread with a single layer of banana slices. Sprinkle half of the blueberries over the bananas and drop spoonfuls of the praline topping over the blueberries, using about half of it. Add another layer of bread and bananas, and top with remaining blueberries. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, syrup, vanilla, and cinnamon. Pour over the bread in the casserole, saturating the top pieces. Spoon on the remaining half of the praline topping. Cover the dish with foil and place on a baking tray. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil for the last 10 minutes of baking. There should be liquid bubbling around the sides and corners when it’s done. Remove from the oven and let sit for a few minutes before serving.

Bake for about 15 minutes. Remove tray from the oven and stir to ensure all granola gets toasted. Return to the oven and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned and fragrant. Watch carefully so as not to burn. Remove tray from oven and let cool slightly, then mix in the dried fruit. Serve with vanilla cashew cream or store in sealed plastic bag or container. To make the vanilla cashew cream, place all the ingredients in a blender and blend on high speed for 1 minute. Cashew cream should be completely smooth and have the consistency of thick milk; you should be able to pour and drink it. Serve immediately or pour into mason jars and chill in the refrigerator before serving. The cream will keep for three to four days. Cashew cream will separate as it sits, so shake well before each use. Lemo-Blueberr Plent Griddl Cake wit Lemo-But e Syru"

      "To make the griddle cakes, start by heating the milk in a small pot just until it simmers. Remove from heat and add in oil, lemon zest, and vanilla. Mix together the polenta, flour, almond meal, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Pour the warmed milk into the polenta mixture and stir to combine. Fold in the blueberries and pine nuts. Let the mixture sit for a few minutes so that the polenta softens and absorbs the liquid. Rinse out the pot. To make the lemon-butter syrup, heat the syrup and butter in the pot until the butter melts. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and lemon extract. Heat about 1 teaspoon of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Use a ¼ cup measure or large spoon to spoon the batter onto the hot pan. (Pancakes should measure 3½ to 4 inches.) Cook until the bottoms are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook for another 3 minutes until bottoms are golden brown. Serve immediately with the warm syrup. Spice Zucchin Carr Brea"

Leave to cool in the pan for 20 minutes. Slide a knife around the edges and invert on a cutting board or plate to remove the bread. Let cool another 5 to 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

Using your fingers, work the coconut oil into the dry ingredients until the particles are the size of small peas. Mix in the chocolate chips. Add the milk and use your hands to gently mix until the dough is slightly sticky and soft. Add a little more milk if necessary. Don’t overwork the dough or scones will be tough, not tender. Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface and form it into an 8-inch circle. Cut the circle into 8 equal triangles with a floured knife or use a biscuit cutter to cut out round scones. Re-roll scraps and make as many scones as you can. Arrange scones on the prepared baking tray, leaving 2 inches between each one. Brush with milk and sprinkle the coarse sugar on top. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned. Remove from the oven and serve the scones warm with vegan butter, jam, or coconut whipped cream. You probably won’t have any to store, but if you do, place extras in a sealed container or zip-top plastic bag. Freshen them up by popping them into the oven for a few minutes. Baked scones freeze well for up to three months. Weeken Waf le wit Fudg Sauc"

To make the chocolate fudge sauce, whisk together the coconut milk, brown sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium pot over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the brown sugar has dissolved, about 6 minutes. Add the butter and stir to melt. Remove pot from heat and stir in vanilla. Set aside to cool slightly before serving. Store extra in a sealed container in the refrigerator and heat desired portion in a microwave-safe bowl for 15 seconds to serve. To make the waffles, mix together, in a medium bowl, the all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. In a small bowl, whisk together the milk, oil, and vanilla. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir gently until a thick batter is formed. The batter should be thick enough that you can scoop up a heaping spoonful. If it’s too thick, add another 1 tablespoon of milk. Read and follow manufacturer’s instructions for your waffle iron. When the waffle iron is hot, spoon the batter so that the surface isn’t entirely covered, allowing room for the batter to spread. Close the lid and wait for the indicator to alert you that the waffle is done. Do not open lid prematurely. Use a fork or toothpick to gently loosen the waffle from the iron. Serve immediately, drizzled with chocolate fudge sauce, or keep warm in the oven. Superfoo Smothi Bowl"

      "To make the peanut butter syrup, mix the syrup and peanut butter together in a small pot over medium heat until smooth, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat, add vanilla, and stir. Cover and set aside. To make the pancakes, whisk together milk and apple cider vinegar in a small bowl. Set aside while preparing the dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, mix together the all-purpose and whole wheat flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir the syrup, oil, and vanilla into the milk mixture and pour this into the bowl with dry ingredients. Stir to combine, being careful not to overmix. Gently stir in the banana. Warm a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Add 1 teaspoon of oil to the pan and carefully spread with a paper towel. Test the temperature by cooking one small pancake first. If the batter sizzles when it hits the pan and forms bubbles on the top after 1 to 2 minutes without burning, your temperature is right. If it doesn’t sizzle, wait 1 or 2 minutes longer, or increase the heat slightly. If the batter burns quickly, turn down the heat and wait for the pan to cool down. Use a ¼ cup measure to create 4-inch pancakes. Pour batter onto the pan and wait until bubbles form on the surface, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle on a few chocolate chips. Use a spatula to flip pancakes and cook for another 1 or 2 minutes or until bottoms are lightly browned. Continue until the batter is gone. To serve pancakes, top with warm peanut butter syrup. Store extra syrup in a covered container for up to 1 week. Tempe Ove Ha"

      "To make the spice blend, mix together all the ingredients in a small bowl. To make the burritos, heat the olive oil in a large pan over mediumhigh heat. Add onion and bell pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add spinach, tofu, and black beans. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the spice mix and stir. Add hot sauce, taste, and adjust seasonings as necessary. Cool for 10 to 15 minutes before assembly to keep your burritos from getting soggy. Divide the mixture into 8 equal portions. Place filling on the bottom third of a wrap and roll while tucking the ends in. Place seam-side down on a cutting board or plate. To freeze, place all of the burritos on a large plate, freeze until solid, and then place in a freezer bag or wrap individually in plastic. The burritos will keep in the freezer for three to six months. Store unused spice blend in a covered container. To heat in the microwave: remove a burrito from the bag or plastic wrap, place on a microwave-safe plate, and tent with a paper towel. Microwave on high for 1 minute, flip the burrito, then microwave for an additional 1 minute, until the burrito is heated through. To heat in the oven: preheat the oven to 350°F. Remove a burrito from the bag or plastic wrap, wrap in foil, and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until heated through, turning over once during baking. Serve immediately. Ultimat Tf Scrambl"

      "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Use a fork to prick the unbaked pie crust several times (both on the bottom and the sides) and place on a baking tray. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the crust is partially baked and just starting to brown. Remove from the oven and set aside. To make the tofu-cashew custard, combine the cashews, tofu, nutritional yeast, mustard, turmeric, and cornstarch in the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Set aside while you prepare the sautéed vegetables. To make the vegetables, heat the oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and a pinch of salt, and cook until mostly translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the sliced asparagus and cook for an additional 5 to 7 minutes, until the asparagus is bright green and just tender when pierced with a fork. Add the garlic, cook for 1 minute or so, until fragrant. Stir in the spinach, crumbled sausage, thyme, salt, and pepper, and cook until heated through. Remove from the heat. Stir the tofu-cashew custard into the vegetable-sausage mixture, until everything is well-incorporated. Pour the mixture into the par-baked pie shell, smoothing the top with the back of a spoon or spatula, and transfer the quiche to the oven. Bake the quiche for 40 to 50 minutes, until the custard is set and the crust is golden brown. If the crust browns before the filling is ready, cover the edges with strips of foil to prevent burning. Remove from the oven, allow to cool for 10 minutes, then slice and serve. Appetizer an Nibble Tonight, we dine! That is the promise of the pre-meal morsel.

      "Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Drizzle the lined baking tray with the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt. Cut potatoes in half, then place them, cut-side down, on the baking tray. Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until potatoes are soft and can be pierced with a sharp knife. Check the face-down sides for a very light golden color. The potatoes should not be allowed to brown otherwise the bite will have resistance. Place chickpeas, garlic, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, black salt, turmeric, cayenne, and black pepper in a blender. Blend until completely creamy and smooth and the chickpea skins are no longer noticeable. This will take several minutes and require the sides to be scraped down intermittently. Taste and adjust flavors, if desired. This will taste strong, but when paired with the potato, it will mellow. When the potatoes are tender, remove from oven and allow to cool for a few minutes. Using a teaspoon or melon baller, scoop out the center of each potato, leaving about ¼-inch border inside so that the potato is stable enough to be filled. Place about one quarter of the scooped-out potato centers into the blender with the chickpea mixture. This will add stability to the filling. (Reserve remaining potato centers for use in another recipe, such as thickening a soup.) Blend everything again, scraping down the sides, until smooth. If necessary, add 1 or 2 teaspoons of water. This should have a very thick consistency. Spoon 1 heaping teaspoon of mixture into the center of each potato. Place the potatoes on a serving platter and garnish with chives and paprika. Serve warm or at room temperature. Cream Whit Bea an Cahe Fondu"

      "To make the tofu-cashew ricotta, combine the cashews, lemon juice, and miso in the bowl of a food processor. Process until mostly smooth, adding in nondairy milk as needed to keep the mixture moving. Add the tofu, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper, and pulse a few times, until mostly blended but not completely smooth—a bit of texture is desirable. Taste, adjust seasoning if desired, and set aside until needed, or refrigerate. To make the squash, preheat the oven to 425°F and line a baking tray with parchment. Pile the butternut squash on the baking tray and drizzle with olive oil and maple syrup. Toss together to coat and arrange in one layer on the baking sheet. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper, transfer to the oven, and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the squash is tender and starting to caramelize. Allow to cool at room temperature or refrigerate. To make the fried sage leaves, pinch the sage leaves from the thick stems, discarding the stems. Line a large plate with paper towels. Heat the oil in a small pan over medium-high heat. Working in small batches of 6 to 8 leaves at a time, fry the leaves in the hot oil for 5 to 10 seconds on each side, flipping with a fork. The leaves should still be green, with no hint of browning. Lift the leaves out to drain on the paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining leaves. Sprinkle them with salt and allow to cool completely. They will crisp up as they cool. Fried sage leaves may be used immediately, or stored in an airtight container at room temperature for two to three days. To assemble the crostini, spread a generous 1 tablespoon of cashewtofu ricotta on a baguette slice, top with a few cubes of butternut squash, and place a sage leaf on top. Serve immediately. Store any remaining ricotta in the refrigerator for up to five days. Roate Grap Crotin wit Cahe Rict "

      "Drain, rinse, and press tofu (pg. 6). To make the tofu feta, whisk together the miso, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, olive oil, vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt in a large bowl. The mixture will be thick. Cut tofu into ¼-inch cubes and add to the bowl with marinade. Stir gently to coat tofu. The tofu feta will be more flavorful if it’s left to marinate for several hours or overnight, but proceed to baking if time does not allow. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Arrange tofu in a single layer and bake for about 25 minutes, or until cubes start to turn golden brown. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. To make the spanakopita, increase oven temperature to 375°F. Line two baking trays with parchment. To make the filling, heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onions and salt. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until they are soft and translucent. Add scallions and stir. Add spinach, nutritional yeast, and nutmeg. When spinach is hot and everything is fully combined, crumble tofu feta into the pan and gently mix, leaving chunks of cheese. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. On a clean countertop, carefully unroll the phyllo dough, laying it out with the longest side horizontal to the edge of the counter. Take one sheet and lay it flat, then brush with a little olive oil (or use your hands to spread the oil). Place another sheet on top, brush again. Then place a third sheet on top and do not oil. Using a sharp knife, cut the stacked sheets horizontally into strips about 3½ inches wide. Place 1 tablespoon of filling in the bottom corner of one strip, closest to you. Fold the end corner over till it meets the opposite edge. Press gently to even out the filling inside. Take the triangle and fold it up and away from you, then continue to fold back and forth, making a triangle pocket. Place it on the prepared baking tray. Repeat the process until all the filling is gone. Brush each triangle with a little olive oil and sprinkle with a bit of salt. Bake for about 20 minutes (with both trays in the oven) or until the phyllo turns golden brown. Remove from the oven and serve immediately. Souther-tyl Chee Bal"

Sanctuar to CHARLIE’S QUESTIONS I am walking past the pond on my way to visit Leo, our special needs baby goat, when I bump into a “Family Tour” standing between two pastures: one where four horses live, the other occupied by four cows, including my “son” Tucker, a massive steer who’s lived with us since a mother and daughter saved his life ten years ago when he was a young calf on his way to slaughter. I stop, and tour guide Em invites me to say hello. There are few things in life I enjoy more than connecting kids with animals, so I happily oblige. The group is comprised of one family of five, three additional families of two or three, and two adults who’ve joined this “G-rated” tour. We don’t discuss agribusiness on this tour. We don’t talk about the impact of our diet on the planet or the other species who inhabit it. We don’t talk about how meat and dairy consumption wreak havoc on human health. Nope. Rather, the Family Tour is designed to foster meaningful connection. It’s designed to show our guests, particularly the pint-sized ones, that cows, chickens, and pigs are as loving, affectionate, and uniquely wonderful as dogs and cats. We sit on the ground with the chickens. If they want to be held, we hold turkeys Michael and Imogen. We kiss the pigs. Well, some of us do. In other words, the Family Tour is a lovefest. We’re planting seeds. “Kids!” I say, facing the group. “Do you want to meet the cows?” A chorus of voices responds, “YES!” I introduce myself and ask the kids’ names: Roxie, Henry, Lucy, Charlie, and Gina. All but Gina are names of current or past residents, which I explain by saying, “Lucy, we have a pig named after you,” and so forth. Two other children, both infants, are both sacked out in Dads’ backpacks. I forego the name game with them. “I’m so glad you want to meet the cows, because I haven’t seen them in about ten days, and I miss them!” I explain. “Why do you miss them?” asks four-year-old Charlie. Charlie has deep brown eyes, fair skin, a smattering of freckles . . . and a twinkle in his eye. “Because they are my friends,” I explain. “Are the horses your friends?” Charlie asks. “They sure are!” “Are the chickens your friends?” Mom shoots me a “You’d better nip this in the bud” glance, so I kneel down right in front of Freckle Face and say, “If we’re gonna go out with the cows, we’ve got to practice something important.” And then, gauging his size, I ask his age: Charlie is four. “And do you ever get a little silly . . . a little goofy?” “A lot!” Charlie offers. “Well, there’s a cow out in the field named Benjamin, and he’s four years old, too. Boy, can he get goofy, just like you. He’s a very, very sweet cow, but if he gets a little excited, we don’t want him to hurt us by accident.” This is the kid-friendly version of, “Parents, keep your eyes on this fella.” I demonstrate a quick, determined jump in place as I throw my hands skyward and shout a sharp, loud, “HAH!” We learned years ago that when a seven-hundred-pound young steer who has no idea of his own strength is barreling toward you, this is the best way to ensure that he stops before you’re potentially in a heap of trouble. (Mind you, Benjamin has never acted like this with a tour. The activity is merely a precaution.) Together, we practice. The grown ups shout “HAH!” and the kids shout “HAH!,” though little Henry will only perform when hiding behind his mom. Good enough. “Let’s go,” I instruct, reaching for a couple of small hands. Charlie offers his. It’s been an unusually wet late summer, so we have to pick our way through the pasture, avoiding small pools of water. “Also,” I add, because kids find hyperbole about poop hilarious, “watch out for poop piles. Cows poop about nine million times a day.” “That’s disgusting,” Henry says. “I have a feeling, Henry, that you would not want to live on a sanctuary,” I say to the little man. “No way,” says Henry, who’s clutching Monster, a pink unicorn with a neon green mane, in his hand while explaining that he wants to live in a castle. Charlie has asked at least a dozen more questions on our walk out to Tucker and friends, and he doesn’t stop when he lays eyes on the 2,500- pound-plus beast lying thirty feet in front of us. He wants to know if Tucker is “the mama horse.” I explain first that Tucker is a cow, and, second, that he is the stepdad in this family of four—stepparents Tucker and Sadie, and stepkids Benjamin and Blossom—who love each other very much. Big-hearted, gentle Tucker especially loves people and enjoys having visitors, so I sit directly in front of his massive head, legs crossed, and begin massaging his ears, his cheeks, his wide forehead. His eyes droop as he relaxes into my hands. As I tell his story and share cow facts that might be interesting to children, I tap my thigh. “Come on guys, who wants to give Tucker a kiss?” I ask, and then by way of example plant a kiss above Tucker’s right eye, another one on his cheek, another on his wet nose. Tucker responds with a scratchy kiss delivered to my cheek. “I do!” shouts Charlie. “I want to kiss him!” “That’s disgusting,” Henry says. A single toss of Tucker’s head would send Charlie sailing, but the tiny child walks confidently to me, settles into my lap, and sits a few inches in front of a cow head the size of his entire body. He plants a kiss on the bridge of Tucker’s nose, and a wide smile spreads across his face. We spend a couple moments, and then Lucy tiptoes over, working through her fear, and places her small hand on Tucker’s neck. Even Henry, encouraged by his dad, comes eventually. He perches on the edge of my knee and tentatively strokes Tucker’s face once before catapulting back towards Dad’s reassuring embrace. A few minutes later, these tiny hearts and I climb the fence and enter a pasture where horses Barclay, Arabelle, Destiny, and Julius live. We talk about horse teeth and, again, about poop (“That’s disgusting,” Henry announces). We also talk about how soft the horses are and about their “hair.” Henry, guardian of Monster the plastic pink unicorn with the flowing neon mane, is fascinated by the horses’ manes and tails. Parents ask questions about the individual horses, and I offer abbreviated versions of their rescue stories because this group is worrisomely oblivious to the instructions about keeping their kids safe, and my focus has become more about watching the children. One by one, I lift them to the horse’s faces so they can, if they choose, safely plant more kisses. We reassemble in front of one of five pig pastures next, and I ask, “Who wants to kiss pigs?!” Henry says emphatically, “I definitely do not want to kiss pigs.” Nor does his sister. Nor does Roxie, and the littlest children are still fast asleep. Charlie is the only taker. “You’re not going to believe how great this is,” I say to him as we march out into the field. “I’m so excited I can hardly stand it! Are you excited, Charlie?” “Yeah! I think my face is going to come off!” I call to Moses, our sweet, spotted boy, who turns and ambles toward us. Charlie is all breath and rapt attention, sitting in my lap as we wait for the big moment. I wrap my arms around his chest; his tiny heart races. But when the six-hundred-pound pig is before us, there’s only time for a brief intro, because Moses has already spotted the rest of the group at the fence line. They’re offering willow branches, a favorite treat for most of our species. No matter: Moses utters a friendly “hello” as Charlie places his hand flatly on the pig’s cool, moist snout. For a few seconds, pig eyes meet human eyes, and I know this is a moment Charlie won’t soon forget. Cajoled by their parents, Henry and Lucy have entered the field not for pig kisses, but for pig butt scratches. I demonstrate how to scratch forcefully to penetrate Moses’ thick skin, and though he uses “disgusting” a dozen times, Henry starts to giggle as Moses responds to the treatment by wiggling from side to side. “Mmmph,” says Moses. “He’s saying thanks,” I tell Henry. A smile, the first one I’ve seen, spreads across Henry’s face. An hour after I usurped Em’s tour, I kneel down to be at eye-level with the children as we say goodbye. As Charlie’s dad whispers to me, “Charlie wants to give you a hug,” the freckle-faced imp comes over and envelopes me in his four-year-old arms. We stay that way for a long, long time. And then, to my astonishment, Henry comes toward me, arms outstretched. I can’t see it, but I think I feel another smile. Some days, a warm bowl of soup can feel like just the hug we need. Made with love and compassion, it can tease out even the most reluctant smile. Days like these were made for peanut-y sweet potato stew (pg. 62), Smoky Three-Bean Chili (pg. 74), and humble lentil stew (pg. 65). Got a little spring in your step? We’ve got a soup for that, too. Soup an tew We believe in soup. Whether carefully constructed or made with lazy abandon, we think most days should have some soup in them.

Heat remaining 3 tablespoons of oil in the same pot over low heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring continually for about 5 minutes. It’s important to stir continually and not allow the mixture to stick to the bottom and burn. When the flour has turn a golden-dark brown, add onion, celery, bell peppers, and garlic. Cook for about 10 minutes, or until vegetables have softened. Add the Cajun seasoning, vegetable broth, zucchini, pecans, and cooked mushrooms. Let the stew come to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until zucchini is tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Taste and adjust seasonings if desired. To serve, spoon rice into the bottom of deep bowls and ladle the gumbo on top. Garnish with scallions. Roate Cauliflowe Garli Sou"

      "Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Place cauliflower, garlic, onions, and thyme on the baking tray and drizzle with the olive oil. Gently toss together and sprinkle with salt. Roast for about 30 to 35 minutes or until all the vegetables are soft and medium brown. Heat the broth while the vegetables are roasting. When the vegetables are done, pick out a few small florets of browned cauliflower for garnish and set aside. Transfer remaining vegetables to a blender. Add the warm vegetable broth and lemon juice and carefully blend. Caution, it’s hot, so remove the plastic handle in the lid and use a towel to gently cover the top of the hole in the blender lid to let steam escape during the blending process. Blend until chunky-smooth, leaving tiny bits and pieces of browned vegetables for visual appeal. Do not overblend into a purée. Alternatively, use an immersion/hand blender. To serve, ladle soup into bowls and place one or two small florets on top and a small sprig of thyme. Moquec (Brazilia te)"

      "In a small pot, simmer vegetable broth with wakame for about 10 minutes. Pour the broth into a bowl through a mesh strainer to remove the sea vegetables, if desired, or leave some in for extra taste, texture, and nutrition. Heat 2 tablespoons of coconut oil in a pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, lay plantain slices in a single layer in the pan and cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until nicely browned. Plantains should be fork-tender when done. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Set aside the pan. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add flour and cook for about 2 minutes, while stirring, until it darkens slightly. Add onions, peppers, garlic, paprika, salt, coriander, and crushed red pepper flakes. Cover and cook until onions and peppers have softened slightly, about 8 minutes. Add tomatoes, hearts of palm, tofu, potatoes, vegetable broth, and coconut milk. Simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, until all the vegetables have softened and potatoes can be pierced with a fork. Stir in lime juice and plantains. To make the farofa, use the pan from the plantains. Heat oil over medium heat. Add garlic, manioc meal or breadcrumbs, and salt. Cook, while stirring, for about 5 minutes until light golden brown and fragrant. Be careful not to burn as it goes from golden to dark brown quickly. Empty into a small bowl and serve with the moqueca, as a garnish. Serve in bowls garnished with farofa and cilantro. lo-Simmere Cannellin Bean an Cllar Green"

      "To make the toasted breadcrumbs, place the bread cubes in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Transfer to a medium pan, drizzle with olive oil, and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the breadcrumbs are lightly browned. Place the finished breadcrumbs in a bowl and set aside until needed. To make the cassoulet, heat the oil in a medium pan over mediumhigh heat. Add the shallots, carrots, celery, and a pinch of salt, and cook until the vegetables are beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and mushrooms, and cook for an additional 5 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant and the mushrooms have released their liquid. Add the potatoes, beans, canned tomatoes, broth, herbs, salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Bring to a boil, then lower to heat to a simmer, cover the pot, and allow to cook gently for 30 to 40 minutes, until the potatoes are tender. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired. Just before serving, stir in the fresh parsley. The cassoulet will keep in the refrigerator for up to five days. Cooled portions can be frozen for up to three months. Sanctuar to BREAKING THE RULES In 2018, we discovered that our supporters actually love to squish around in the mud with pigs, tiptoe through the coolness of the main barn in order not to wake Hannah, our elderly blind sheep, and step into the turkey barn to feel what we mean when we say, “You’re about to have an experience you’ll remember for the rest of your lives.” I lead these aptly named “Break All the Rules” tours, and it’s a toss-up as to who enjoys them more: the guests, the animals, or me. The weather, which of the animals are most accessible, the composition of the group, and the personality and energy level of its members: these things and more make each “Break All the Rules Tour” entirely unique. Group dynamics help inform whether we climb fences or open gates, sit in a semi-circle surrounding giant Tucker or stand a respectful distance, have a full-out love-fest with the pigs versus me being the only one doing all the pig kissing. In general, though, these unconventional tours lean heavily toward lovefests. We focus on the animals who crave affection and who give back as much or more love than is offered them. Tucker’s head droops and his eyes blink slowly as he accepts gentle scratches on his cheeks, forehead, neck, and shoulders. Jasmine the pig stares without guile into the souls of those who sit in front of her. Turkeys Michael and Imogen nestle fully into the laps of unsuspecting guests, who typically sit silently, tears rolling down their cheeks, often uttering a sentence that begins with “I had no idea . . .” “Yes,” I say. “Turkeys are love on two legs.” Catskill Animal Sanctuary tours change lives. We speak the truth, always with love, about the urgency of veganism, not only for the animals, not only for our precious planet, but also for our very survival. But it’s the animals—these precious animals with their glorious individuality, their capacity to forgive, their breathtaking full-heartedness—who speak with a clarity that simply cannot be misunderstood. Ninety-three percent of our non-vegan guests say they intend to reduce or eliminate animal products from their diet as a result of visiting Catskill Animal Sanctuary. We have Tucker, Jasmine, Michael, and so many more to thank for that. And just like our tours changes lives, so do our recipes. Whether you’re feeling famished or peckish, our sides and salads will satisfy all kinds of appetites and all kinds of eaters. From Chickpea Waldorf Salad (pg. 86) to Stovetop Mac and Cheese (p. 105), these dishes can play a supporting or starring role—you decide. Side an Salad Call it a side dish or a salad. Make it your main meal of the day or a midday lunch. These dishes are made to either stand obediently at the sidelines or to march right in to take center stage—it’s up to you.

Add to the bowl and stir to coat. The tofu will be more flavorful if left to marinade for several hours or overnight, but proceed if time does not allow. Preheat oven to 350°F. Arrange tofu in a single layer on a baking tray lined with parchment. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until cubes turn light brown. Set aside to cool. To make the salad, cook orzo according to package directions. Rinse with cold water, drain, and empty into a large bowl. Stir in chickpeas, tomatoes, olives, artichoke hearts, and basil. To make the dressing, place all of the ingredients, except for the salt, in a food processor and pulse into a chunky blend; do not purée. Taste and add more salt and lemon juice if desired. Dressing should have a strong flavor so that it stands up to the orzo. Pour dressing over orzo and toss to combine. Add tofu feta and toss again.

      "To make polenta croutons, preheat oven to 425°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Place cubed polenta in a large bowl and toss with the olive oil. Add nutritional yeast, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt. Toss to coat. Arrange polenta in a single layer on the baking tray and roast for 15 to 20 minutes stirring midway through baking. The croutons are done when the sides are golden brown. To make the nut parmesan, place all the ingredients in a food processor and pulse until mixture resembles coarse sand. Taste and adjust seasonings, adding more salt or garlic, if you choose. To make the dressing, place all the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Add more water to thin, if necessary, 1 tablespoon at a time. Dressing should taste very strong. It will mellow when the salad is assembled. To assemble the salad, place kale and romaine in a large bowl. Add the desired amount of dressing and toss to combine. Store leftover dressing in a covered container for up to one week. Top salad with polenta croutons and sprinkle with nut parmesan. Store leftover parmesan in the refrigerator for several weeks or freeze. Lemo Heart  Pal Sala"

      "Bring 3½ cups water to a boil. Add rice and salt. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes. Add quinoa. Stir and cover again. Cook for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until the rice and quinoa are tender. Drain excess water and empty into a very large bowl or onto a baking tray to cool. While the rice and quinoa are cooking, cook edamame according to package instructions. Drain and rinse in cold water. Avoid overcooking edamame or it will result in a dull green color instead of bright green. To make the shiitake crisps, preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Place sliced mushrooms in a mound on the baking tray. Drizzle with the oil. Toss to coat and arrange in a single layer. Sprinkle with salt and paprika. Roast for about 25 minutes, stopping to stir about halfway through cooking time. Mushrooms are done when they are dark brown, almost burnt. Transfer to a paper towel– lined plate to cool. While rice, quinoa, and mushrooms are cooking, make the vinaigrette by whisking lime juice, vinegar, tamari, olive oil, toasted sesame oil, syrup, and ginger together in a large bowl. Taste and adjust with salt or more lime juice. Add the cooled rice and quinoa, edamame, pistachios, and scallions to the bowl with the dressing. Toss to combine. Serve immediately, topped with shiitake crisps, or chill before serving. Cahe Frie Ric"

Mushrooms are done when they are dark brown, almost burnt. Transfer to a paper towel– lined plate to cool. To make the green beans, heat oil over medium- high in a large (12- inch) frying pan; cast iron works very well. Let the oil get hot enough so that a green bean sizzles when added. Working in batches, add enough green beans to cover the bottom of the pan. Let them cook for a several minutes without stirring so that they blacken and blister a little. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 8 minutes, until green beans are partly charred and mostly crisp, but a little tender to the bite. Transfer green beans to a plate and repeat until all the green beans are cooked. Add the leeks, garlic, and salt to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the leeks are softened and translucent, another 5 minutes. Return all the green beans to the pan and stir in balsamic, syrup, and black pepper.

Let the mixture cool while you start the macaroni. Boil the macaroni in salted water, according to package directions. Blend the cheese sauce for about 1½ minutes, until smooth and glossy. Taste and add more salt or lemon juice if you like. To make the nut parmesan, put all of the ingredients in a food processor and pulse until finely ground. When the pasta is done, drain and return it to the pot. Add most of the cheese sauce and stir to combine. It will seem very saucy, but the pasta will absorb the sauce as it sits. Serve immediately, drizzled with additional sauce and garnished with nut parmesan. Store the remaining nut parmesan in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to one month. Extra sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for up to five days or frozen for up to six months. Spice Cabbag an Cauliflowe"

Cook while stirring, for a minute or two, until fragrant. Add cauliflower as the bottom layer, then pepper strips, then cabbage, sprinkling a little salt on each layer as you go. Cover tightly and cook for about 25 minutes. Tightly covering the pot creates steam which helps to cooks the vegetables through. When done, the cabbage and cauliflower should be tender, but not mushy. Check the texture about midway through cooking. Add lemon juice then toss gently in the pan and taste. Adjust seasonings if necessary, adding more heat or salt. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with chopped cilantro. Confet  Cauliflowe “Ric ” an Bean"

      "Combine the farro and water in a large pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and allow to simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, until the farro is tender but not mushy. Drain excess water and set the farro aside. Heat the oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms and garlic, and cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes, until the mushrooms have released their liquid and the garlic is fragrant. Pour in the wine and allow it to bubble and reduce for another minute or so, scraping up any flavorful bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the salt, cooked farro, cranberries, pecans, fresh herbs, and a few grinds of black pepper, and mix well. Taste, adjust seasonings as desired, and serve. The pilaf will keep in the refrigerator for up to five days. Sanctuar to ON LOVE, LOSS, AND HOT DOGS When a local fundraiser Go Dog Go was held to support dog rescue efforts, I was invited to be one of three judges of their “show.” I jumped at the opportunity—there was fun to be had. I was in the company of Bruce Littlefield, bestselling author and “arbiter of fun,” and Pia Salk, a psychologist, animal lover, and live wire. Judging spackle would have been fun with these two, but when you add the fact that the divisions of this “dog show” were “Bad Hair Day,” “Most Mysterious Heritage,” “I Look Like My Mama,” and so on, and that dog kisses were available on demand, well . . . the day was custom made for me. In fact, Go Dog Go is the only kind of dog show I could ever support. While Go Dog Go would have been my idea of a good time anytime, on this day, it was especially meaningful after a tough week of saying goodbye to my beloved Babe, a seventeen-year-old steer who touched thousands of lives at Catskill Animal Sanctuary and whom I loved every bit as much as I love The Great Dog Chumbley, who sleeps at the foot of my bed every night. If ever there was a big, hairy ball of lovableness, it was Babe. Babe, all 1,800-ish pounds of him, arrived at Catskill Animal Sanctuary in 2003. We were a fledgling organization . . . and we looked it. We had just purchased our property, a forlorn, forgotten farm that needed rescuing every bit as much as the animals who would soon arrive, when big Babe barreled down the drive. Babe’s human friend had rescued him at an auction, wanting to save one life. She’d bottle-fed him, kept him in her backyard until he simply grew too big, then boarded him, rather ironically, at a beef farm. When she divorced, she could no longer afford his board, and the farmer gave her a month to find him a home. Fortunately for Babe, and fortunately for us, his human found Catskill Animal Sanctuary. I am flooded with memories of the placid being with the soft eyes and the tongue that reached out expertly to grab one carrot, then another, and then another until a five-pound bag was gobbled up. Among my favorite memories: BABE THE HOMEBODY I’m not sure why—maybe our fencing didn’t stand a chance against our new “moose”—but for a short while, Babe was a free-ranger. Only he never went anywhere. Free to roam the entire farm, Babe instead stood in the middle of the barn aisle, motionless as Peepers the duck patrolled the barn by waddling frantically back and forth under Babe’s belly. “QuackQUACK!!” Peepers said, rushing under the black giant, who stood unfazed as he eyed the feed room. Surrounded by free-ranging ducks, chickens, goats, sheep, and a growing human fan club, Babe seemed supremely at peace. BABE THE BRUTE Once, a bunch of us were cleaning the cow field. I stood atop the tractor bucket to bellow instructions to volunteers who were spread throughout the large pasture. Babe wandered up to say hello, but got so close that when he turned his head to flick a fly away, he sent me sailing through the air. I landed with a thud, gathered my breath, then laughed hysterically. Babe startled, but then walked over and licked my head. BABE THE RINGLEADER 6:30 a.m. Two police cars pulled down our driveway. “Are you missing somebody?” a young cop asked. I remember the wry smile on his face; somehow I knew that this was code for “Your cows are in town.” And in the town they were, all right—Babe had led his herd through the woods, down our local rural lane, and onto the very busy Rt. 9W . . . and then he’d just stood there. The escapade, and our return walk home (I put a bright green draft horse halter on Babe and led him down the road while the others followed) was on the evening news. BABE THE WISEMAN Several summers ago, the renowned Omega Institute invited us to bring animals for their animal communication workshop. We don’t typically oblige such requests, and have turned down dozens more to provide animals for school fairs, Nativity scenes, and even a movie shoot in Central Park. But this felt different. We’d be outside, by the pond, where the animals could relax, graze, and essentially be loved for a weekend. So we took our best ambassadors, and our most social friends—the ones we felt would truly enjoy the experience. Whether or not we learned how to “communicate” with them (I believe all of us are communicating all the time but am ambivalent about how “animal communication” is often taught), I wanted our animal friends to open the hearts of those whose previous experiences had only included dogs and cats. I didn’t expect that Babe would want to join us. Like many of us, cows are frightened of unfamiliar situations. Yet when I opened the trailer door, he evidently did because he stepped right in and cozied up next to Chester the horse. That he had absolute trust was remarkable enough. And while maybe it’s a stretch to say that on some level he knew we needed him, that’s surely what it felt like. Throughout the weekend, the communicator guided us through various relaxation techniques, after which we would open ourselves to the messages our friends wished to share. I was blown away by our animals’ comfort level and their obvious connection to their Catskill people (six staff members had been given the chance to attend the workshop)—how much we learned from them! The instructor decided that Babe would be the final animal with whom we’d practice. This is exactly what happened: we had just finished “speaking with” our old, hilarious Appaloosa named Chester, who put his head down to graze in the meadow where we’d gathered. “Let’s turn our attention now to this big guy,” the teacher said, gesturing toward Babe, and as she suggested that we form a circle around him, Babe walked right into the middle. Then, as she’d done with each of the animals, she invited us to close our eyes. As she spoke softly and we breathed slowly and deeply, my eyes stayed open, and I watched a huge black head droop. “Relax,” she whispered, and he did. Babe’s giant head dropped lower, and lower still, until right before his knees were about to buckle, he folded his legs and lay down. And that’s when I received a clear and plaintive and powerful message. “We don’t want to be hamburger,” is one part I remember, along with: “I hope I’m doing a good job. Thank you for choosing me.” To this day, I’m not sure what to make of that moment. I don’t recall what anyone said about what Babe “communicated” to them. But I do recall many of them weeping, one woman sitting in front of him and cradling his massive head as he licked her face, and another woman draping her body over Babe’s back (after she saw me do it). And I remember the thought that struck me like a lightning bolt: “These people will never eat meat again.” Back to my story: I suppose the organizers of Go Dog Go thought it would be clever to sell “hot dogs” (and nothing more) at a “dog show.” But the “hot dogs” were not “hot” (as in cooked) “dogs” (as in the animal) at all. They were cooked cows. I’m fairly certain that our Babe, and every other cow or pig who’s ever lived, if given the “Bad Hair Day” or “Become a Hot Dog” choice, would have chosen the former. I stood in line behind half a dozen animal lovers, all of whom ordered cooked cows. “I’ll have the veggie burrito,” I said to the vendor, who in the eleventh hour had put them on her menu at my request. “I have a pet pig,” she said as we chatted briefly about my special request. “He’s really something.” “They’re remarkable animals,” I responded. “Are you vegan?” “Me?” she laughed. “Never. I love my meat.” Eating vegan does not mean forsaking hearty, meaty foods. Consider a Cuban Jackfruit Sandwich, crispy and oozing with cheese (pg. 117), a Shepherd’s Pie piled high with mashed potatoes (pg. 161), or a thick slice of Meatless Meatloaf doused in gravy (pg. 145). We, too, love our meat—ours just happens to be made from plants. Mai Meal Without the hope of something delicious or familiar to hitch our hunger to, eating vegan might seem elusive. We’ll wish for a burger piled high with toppings to sink our teeth into. We’ll pine for meatballs smothered in sauce. And the day will come when nothing short of creamy fettuccine will tame our passions. Luckily, eating vegan doesn’t mean foregoing any of these. These main meals have been created to soothe and gratify, to delight and surprise, and to reassure us that choosing compassion eliminates only the suffering, not the satisfaction.

      "Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. To make the marinade, in a large bowl, whisk together orange juice, lime juice, mayonnaise, syrup, tamari, garlic, cilantro, onion powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Use a food processor to chop the jackfruit. Alternatively, chop the jackfruit with a sharp knife. You may have to cut out hard centers of the jackfruit pieces and discard before chopping. Add chopped jackfruit to the bowl with the marinade. Mix well. Spread the jackfruit on the lined baking tray and bake for about 30 minutes until edges start to brown slightly. To assemble the sandwiches, split the bread and spread mustard liberally on both sides. Place one slice of cheese on the top of the roll and one on the bottom, then layer the sandwich with ham, pickles, and jackfruit in between. To cook, melt butter in a large pan (cast iron works well) over medium heat. Depending on the size of your pan, place one or two sandwiches in the pan and top with another heavy pan or pot, then put something heavy in the top pan or pot to help press the sandwiches down as they cook; canned beans or tomatoes work well. Sandwiches should be pressed to about half their original thickness. Cook for about 5 minutes per side, pressing down occasionally, until the sandwiches have flattened, the bread is toasted, and the cheese has melted. Alternatively, use an electric panini grill. Cut in half and serve immediately. Swee Ptat Blac Bea Burrito wit Cahe Her Crea"

      "Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Lightly oil a 9-inch square baking dish and set aside. To make the sweet potatoes, place them along with the bell pepper and onion on the baking tray in a pile. Drizzle with the oil. Sprinkle with chili powder, cumin, cinnamon, salt, and cayenne. Use your hands to toss together, coating everything with spices and oil. Arrange in a single layer. Place the tray in oven and roast for about 20 minutes, or until sweet potatoes are fork-tender, but not mushy, and the bell peppers and onions are tender. When done, remove from oven and reduce temperature to 375°F. To make the black beans, place them in a bowl with ½ cup of salsa and salt. Use a wooden spoon or fork to mash the beans and the salsa together so that you end up with a spreadable filling. To assemble, lay a tortilla flat on a cutting board. Spread about ¼ cup of black bean–salsa mixture on the tortilla, leaving a ¼-inch border. Arrange ⅓ to ½ cup of sweet potato mixture evenly over the black beans about a third of the way up from the bottom edge closest to you. Lay 2 to 3 slices of avocado across the sweet potatoes. Using a firm hand, begin rolling away from you, while folding and tucking the ends in. Place burritos seam side down in the prepared baking dish and repeat until ingredients have been used. Spoon about half of the cashew-herb cream over burritos. Place the baking dish in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes, to heat through. Serve immediately, garnished with the remaining half of the cashew cream and remaining ¼ cup tomato salsa. Garnish with cilantro. Alternatively, you can serve without baking.

Cook for another 8 to 10 minutes to ensure flavor is distributed throughout. Serve on buns topped with another dollop of BBQ sauce. Compassionat “Cra” Cake wit Remoulad Sauc"

      "To make the “crab” cakes, measure out ¾ cup of the breadcrumbs into a shallow dish and set aside. In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, capers, lemon juice, kelp flakes, mustard, Old Bay Seasoning, salt, ground pepper, and cayenne. Add hearts of palm or jackfruit, bell pepper, celery, parsley, shallots, the remaining ¾ cup of breadcrumbs, and stir to combine. If using jackfruit, add an extra 1 heaping tablespoons of vegan mayonnaise. Let stand for about 10 minutes to allow the breadcrumbs to bind everything together. Gently shape “crab” cake mixture into patties, about 3 inches wide and ½ inch thick. Dredge the patties in breadcrumbs. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry cakes until golden brown and crisp, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Alternatively, to bake the cakes, preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Brush parchment with oil and arrange cakes on it several inches apart. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, carefully flipping midway through. Serve immediately with a dollop of remoulade sauce on top.

Next, place oats, walnuts, chili powder, paprika, cumin, and salt into the processor and pulse several times, leaving some texture to the nuts and oats. Empty into bowl with beet mixture. Finally, place beans and mayonnaise in the processor and pulse to combine, leaving some texture to the beans. Empty into the bowl with the other ingredients and mix everything together. Use a medium portion scoop or ⅓ measuring cup to form each patty. Use an offset spatula or knife to flatten and create uniform burgers that are 1½ inches thick and about 3 inches wide. Place burgers on tray in oven and bake for about 30 minutes. Remove tray from oven and let burgers sit for about 5 minutes to set. Serve alone or on buns with all of the fixings—lettuce, tomato, avocado, and avocado-scallion sauce.

      "To make shiitake crisps, preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Place shiitake slices in a mound on the baking tray and drizzle with oil. Toss to coat with oil. Arrange in a single layer and sprinkle with salt and paprika. Roast for about 25 minutes, or until mushrooms are very dark, almost burnt. Remove tray from oven and let cool. Mushrooms will crisp up as they cool. Start the pasta by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Place beans, artichoke hearts, drained cashews, nutritional yeast, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a blender and purée until velvety and smooth. While the pasta is cooking, make the pan-roasted tomatoes. Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add tomatoes and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, or until tomatoes become just soft. Add garlic and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. When pasta is done, drain, reserving about ½ cup of cooking water, and return to the pot. With the pot over medium heat, add sauce and toss to combine, adding reserved water to thin to your desired consistency. Serve pasta in individual bowls or in a large serving bowl. Top with tomatoes, shiitake crisps, and garnish with parsley. Coconu Mapl Squa Bowl"

      "Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Brush or spread oil on the parchment and set aside. To make the breaded eggplant, place flour and milk in two separate bowls. In a third bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, nutritional yeast, pepper, garlic powder, oregano, basil, onion powder, salt, and pepper. To bread the eggplant, dredge slices in flour, dip in the milk, then dredge in breadcrumbs. Place eggplant slices in a single layer on the baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes then flip each slice and bake for another 10 minutes, until the eggplant is soft. (The key is cutting eggplant into thin slices.) Remove from the oven and reduce heat to 375°F. While eggplant is baking, make the tofu ricotta. Finely crumble the tofu into a medium bowl. Add nutritional yeast, lemon juice, olive oil, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt. Mix until all ingredients are thoroughly combined. To assemble, lightly oil a 9-inch square baking dish. Spread about ¾ cup of the marinara sauce on the bottom of the dish. Arrange slices of eggplant over the sauce in order to cover the bottom of the dish. Spread half the tofu ricotta mixture on top of the eggplant and sprinkle with ½ cup of mozzarella. Make a second layer by adding another ¾ cup sauce and arranging eggplant over the sauce. Spread the remaining half of the tofu ricotta over the eggplant and sprinkle ½ cup of mozzarella, and top with another ¾ cup of sauce. Finish with a final layer of eggplant, the remaining sauce, and remaining mozzarella. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes, until bubbling around the sides. Let sit for about 5 minutes to set before cutting and serving. Peca-Crute Tempe Cutlet"

      "In a wide, shallow bowl, whisk together the ground flaxseed and water, and set aside. Preheat the oven to 375°F and line a baking tray with parchment. Cut the block of tempeh in half horizontally, making two thin planks. Cut each plank into four triangles or rectangles to yield a total of 8 cutlets. Place the tempeh in small pot with water and tamari. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat, and allow to simmer for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the three-part breading station. Arrange three wide, shallow bowls on your counter. In one bowl, stir together the flour, nutritional yeast, salt, thyme, sage, marjoram, and pepper. In the second bowl, you’ll have the thickened flaxseed mixture. Finally, place the finely chopped pecans in the third bowl. Transfer the tempeh from its simmering liquid to a plate and allow to cool briefly. Dip a cutlet into the flour mixture and shake off any excess. Next, dip it into the flaxseed mixture. Finally, dip it in the chopped pecans and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining cutlets until everything is coated. Place the tray in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Flip the cutlets and bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oven and serve. Tende Seita Cutlet"

Alternatively, use a food processor to pulse the chickpeas, leaving a finely ground texture. Add in the vegetable broth, olive oil, tamari, nutritional yeast, onion powder, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, and black pepper and mix thoroughly. Stir in the wheat gluten until the mixture begins to pull together, then use your hands to gently knead the dough right in the bowl. Divide the dough into fourths and press each piece of dough into an oval patty roughly 4 to 5 inches wide. Place a patty on a square of aluminum foil and wrap snugly. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Transfer the foil-wrapped cutlets to a steamer basket set over boiling water. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to medium-low, and allow the cutlets to steam for 40 minutes. When finished, remove from the steamer, allow to cool briefly, then remove the foil. The cutlets can be used immediately or allowed to cool, wrapped in plastic wrap to store in the refrigerator or freezer. Extra cutlets will keep in the fridge for up to five days, and in the freezer for up to three months. Italia-tyl Lenti Meatball"

      "Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray with parchment and brush lightly with oil. Place lentils, water, and ½ teaspoon of the salt in a small pot on the stove. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 20 to 25 minutes or until lentils are tender. Add water as needed to make sure lentils are just barely covered. Remove from heat and drain excess water, if necessary. Set aside. In a food processor, pulse mushrooms, onion, and garlic until chopped. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Empty contents of food processor into the pan and add remaining 1 teaspoon of salt. Cook, while stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, or until the onions have softened, mushrooms have browned, and moisture has nearly evaporated. While the mushroom mixture is cooking, place the cooked lentils, oats, parsley, oregano, basil, and pepper in the food processor. Pulse several times but don’t overblend as some texture is desired. Add the cooked mushroom mixture to the food processor and pulse to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings. Let the meatball mixture sit for about 10 minutes, until it holds together when formed into a ball. Use a tablespoon or portion scoop to measure out the desired sized balls, and roll. Arrange on the baking tray. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, turning occasionally to ensure all sides are browned and the balls are firm on the outside. Alternatively, the lentil meatballs can be fried in a little oil on the stovetop. Serve over pasta, spaghetti squash, or on a roll. Make sure to add your favorite tomato sauce.

Arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking tray, and transfer to the oven. Roast for 25 to 30 minutes, until the tofu is brown and the texture is firm.

Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1 or 2 minutes. Add the curry powder and flour, cooking for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, until fragrant. Whisk in the hot vegetable stock and tamari, stirring well to help the sauce thicken evenly. Stir in the apple, squash, potatoes, and carrots, then bring to a boil. Cover, reduce to low-medium heat, and allow to cook for 25 to 30 minutes, until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the roasted tofu, taste and adjust seasonings as necessary, and serve.

      "To make the bolognese, pulse the mushrooms and walnuts in a food processor until finely chopped. Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and walnuts. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms start to give off moisture and darken, about 8 minutes. Add tamari and continue to cook until mushrooms are dark brown and moisture has evaporated. Add the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, salt, crushed red pepper flakes, and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Add tomato sauce, vegetable broth, milk, tomato paste, nutritional yeast, and lemon juice. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, until the sauce has thickened but is still loose enough to ladle onto the polenta. Add a little more broth by the tablespoon to thin, if necessary. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if necessary. To make polenta, bring water to a boil in a large pot over medium heat. When water begins to boil, add olive oil, nutritional yeast, and salt. Reduce heat to low. Gradually pour in the polenta, whisking continuously until it has thickened and is soft and creamy, 1 or 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cover. To make the greens, heat oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add greens, garlic, and salt. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until greens have wilted but are still bright green. Sprinkle lemon juice over greens and toss. To serve, scoop polenta into a bowl, add a hearty spoonful of bolognese sauce, and top with greens. Extra sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or frozen for up to six months. When reheating, thin the sauce with a little water or vegetable broth.

      "To make the marinade for the portobello, put oil, vinegar, tamari, Worcestershire, and garlic in a zip-top plastic bag and add mushroom strips. Gently shake to combine. Place bag of mushrooms in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight. Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large baking tray with parchment. Remove the mushrooms, reserving ¼ cup of the marinade. Arrange slices in a single layer on the tray and pour the reserved marinade over the mushrooms. Roast for about 25 minutes, or until mushrooms are smaller and very dark. They should be thick and juicy. While mushrooms are roasting, make the rosemary beans. Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes or until onions are translucent and soft. Add garlic, rosemary, and salt and cook a few minutes more, until the rosemary and garlic are fragrant. Stir in beans, broth, and lemon juice, and cook for another 5 minutes. Use a fork to mash the beans in the pan into a thick, chunky mixture or purée them in a food processor. Add more broth if you prefer a thinner consistency. Season with ground black pepper. Top beans with roasted mushroom slices and remaining juice from the baking tray. Garnish with chopped parsley. Serve immediately. Meatles Meatloa wit Simpl Glde Grav"

      "Lightly oil two 5¾-by-3¼-inch mini loaf pans. Alternatively, you can shape loaves with your hands and place on a parchment–lined baking tray or use a muffin pan so each person has an individual serving. Bake time will be slightly less when using a muffin pan. Pick over the lentils, discarding any withered ones or stones. Place in a medium saucepan with 1 teaspoon of salt, cover generously with water, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, until tender. Drain the lentils. Preheat oven to 375°F. Place chopped onion, carrots, celery, and garlic into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until vegetables are finely chopped, leaving some texture. Heat the oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Transfer vegetables to the pan. Add thyme, sage, remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, and ground black pepper. Cook until the vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes. While the vegetables are cooking, place mushrooms, walnuts, cooked lentils, and Worcestershire sauce into the bowl of the food processor. Pulse until ingredients are just combined, retaining visible chunks and texture. Do not over-process or the result will be too mushy to hold together when sliced. Transfer mushrooms to the pan with chopped vegetables and cook for about 5 minutes more. Add breadcrumbs and stir to combine. Let mixture sit in the pan for about 15 minutes, until the breadcrumbs have softened and can bind the loaves together. Divide the mixture equally between the two prepared loaf pans and pack down very firmly using the back of a spoon. Cover with foil. Bake for 20 minutes then remove foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until top and sides have browned and the lentil loaves have started to pull away from the sides of the loaf pans. When loaves are done, they will be brown along the edges and firm to the touch. Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes; resting will help the loaf to keep its shape when slicing. Slide a knife along the edges and invert on a serving plate or cutting board. Flip back over so the tops are right side up. Cut into slices and serve immediately with simple golden gravy.

Cover pan and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, or until squash is fork-tender. When done, remove from heat, keep covered, and set aside. To assemble the roll, preheat the oven to 400°F. Lay out a piece of parchment paper about the size of your baking tray. Unfold one sheet of puff pastry on the parchment. Roll the pastry sheet into a 16-by-12- inch rectangle. With the longest side horizontal to the counter, spoon the butternut filling onto the bottom half of the pastry sheet to within 1 inch of the edge. Starting at the side closest to you, roll the pastry sheet and filling up like a jelly roll. Tuck the ends under to seal. Lift the parchment paper up and onto the baking sheet. Brush with oil and sprinkle a little coarse salt on top. Cut 3 or 4 diagonal slits several inches apart in the pastry to allow steam to escape. Bake for 25 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown all over. Remove the oven and let cool for about 5 minutes. Use a serrated knife to slice into desired-sized portions.

      "Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and ½ teaspoon of salt. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, until mushrooms have reduced in size and turned medium brown. The pan should be hot enough so that the mushrooms “squeak” when stirred. Transfer mushrooms to a bowl. In the same pot, add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Add carrots and onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms back into the pot and sprinkle the flour over vegetables and stir again. Stir in broth, wine, tomato paste, garlic, thyme, remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, black pepper, and bay leaf. Cover, then simmer over low-medium heat for about 30 minutes. When done, sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and carrots should be fork-tender. Taste and adjust salt and pepper, if desired. To make the braised onions, heat oil over medium- high heat in a large pan. Add pearl onions and cook, rolling them around to brown evenly, for about 5 minutes. Add broth, thyme, salt, and bay leaf. Cover and simmer over low heat for 20 to 25 minutes, or until onions are tender and most of the broth has evaporated. Onions and mushrooms should be done at about the same time. While both the onions and the mushrooms are cooking, prepare potatoes, rice, or noodles. Remove bay leaf and thyme sprigs from mushrooms and onions. To serve, place potatoes, rice, or noodles in a bowl, ladle on mushrooms and sauce, and place several onions on top. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley.

      "Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. To make the squash and mushrooms, stir together miso, oil, garlic, syrup, and tamari in a large bowl. Add squash and mushrooms to the bowl with the miso mixture and toss to coat evenly. The mixture will be thick, so use a big spoon or rubber spatula, but be gentle so as not to break the mushrooms. Empty onto the prepared baking tray and roast for about 25 minutes. Stir midway through the cooking time. Cook until the squash is fork-tender and lightly browned and the mushrooms are dark brown. While the squash and mushrooms are roasting, make the rice and kale. Place rice, water, and salt in a large pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 10 minutes. Place the chopped kale on top of rice to steam and continue cooking, covered, for about 8 minutes more, or until the liquid has evaporated. Remove from heat and keep covered for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice and kale with a fork. To make the sauce, whisk together peanut butter, tamari, toasted sesame oil, syrup, and hot sauce. Slowly add water, by the tablespoon, and whisk continuously until a thick, pourable consistency is reached. To serve, scoop rice and kale into bowls, top with squash and mushrooms. Garnish with scallions and peanuts and drizzle sauce over everything. Serve immediately. Tempe, hiitak, an Gree Te Noodl Bowl"

Pulse ingredients until finely chopped, but not completely blended. To make the rice, place rice, water, and salt in a pot. Bring water to a boil, then cover and reduce to a simmer. Cook for about 18 minutes or until all the water is absorbed. Remove from heat and keep covered for 5 minutes. Remove cover, sprinkle rice with lime juice, and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm and set aside. To make the tofu, heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Crumble the tofu into the pan. Add cumin, oregano, chili powder, syrup, salt, and cayenne. Toss to coat the tofu with the spices, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes until spices are fragrant. Add beans, olives, and sofrito. Stir to combine and cook for about 20 minutes, until sofrito is cooked and flavors are combined. To serve, build bowls with rice, tofu and bean sofrito, avocado, lettuce, and cheese.

While the sweet potatoes are roasting, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook according to package directions. When pasta is done, drain and reserve about 1 cup of cooking water. Return pasta to the pot and add the spinach pesto. Gently toss to combine, using reserved cooking water to thin pesto, if necessary.

      "Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil a 9-inch by 13-inch casserole dish. To make the shells, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta shells and oil (to prevent sticking) and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, until al dente (slightly firm to the bite). Drain and rinse under cold water. To make the tofu ricotta, finely crumble the tofu into a medium bowl. Mix in remaining ingredients. To make the filling, heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, stirring occasionally, until soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the sausage, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the spinach, garlic, oregano, basil, crushed red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. Cook several more minutes until heated through. Remove from heat. Add the ricotta and ½ cup of mozzarella to the pan. Stir to combine. Spread a few tablespoons of sauce on the bottom of the casserole dish. Use a spoon to generously fill the shells and arrange them, open side up, in the casserole dish. Spoon the remaining marinara sauce over the shells. Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella. Cover with foil and bake for about 25 minutes, until the sauce bubbles around the edges. Remove foil and continue baking for another 10 minutes, or until the edges start to brown and crsip.

      "To make the mashed potato topping, cover potatoes with cold water in a large pot and add the salt. Bring to a low boil then reduce heat to keep potatoes at a low simmer until fork-tender. Drain potatoes and return them to the pot. Add vegetable broth, cream cheese, butter, and nutmeg. Using a potato masher or electric beater, slowly mix until potatoes are relatively smooth and creamy. Don’t overmix or potatoes will be gluey. Some chunks are welcome. To make the lentils for the filling, add them to a pot along with salt. Cover with at least 2 inches of water, about 2½ cups. Bring the water to a rapid simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce to medium-low and gently simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until lentils are tender but not mushy. Add more liquid if necessary. Strain any remaining water. Preheat the oven to 375°F. While the lentils and potatoes are cooking, make the rest of the filling. Heat the oil in a large (12-inch) cast iron skillet or oven-proof pan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme, sage, salt, and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the moisture from the mushrooms has cooked down and the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle cornstarch over vegetables and stir. Add ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, broth and stir. Add the cooked lentils and peas to the pan and stir to combine. If the sauce is too thick, add a little water or broth to thin. There should be an ample amount of sauce with the filling; it should not be dry. Spread the mixture evenly in the pan. Spoon dollops of potatoes over the filling and spread, leaving swoops and swirls, to cover. Bake until the filling bubbles around the sides and the topping starts to turn golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately. Alternatively, you can serve from the pan without baking.

      "Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large baking tray with parchment. In a small pot, cover the tempeh with the water and tamari. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 10 minutes. Drain tempeh. Arrange the seasoned tempeh, potatoes, and Brussels sprouts on the baking tray in a single layer. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Use your hands to toss together and coat everything with oil. Roast in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until potatoes and Brussels sprouts can be pierced easily with a sharp knife. While tempeh and vegetables are roasting, make the piccata sauce. Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, until onion is soft and translucent. Add the mushrooms, garlic, and butter. Continue to cook for about 8 minutes, until mushrooms have browned and cooked all the way through. Make a slurry by stirring together in a small bowl the cornstarch and a couple of tablespoons of the broth until smooth; this prevents lumps in the sauce. Pour this into the pan and quickly add the remaining broth while stirring. Cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens. Stir in lemon juice, capers, and black pepper. Transfer tempeh and vegetables from baking tray to pan. Stir to coat with sauce and remove from heat. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley. Lentil wit Pa-Frie Fenne an Celer Ro"

Add fennel and salt. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for about 7 more minutes, until the fennel starts to soften and turn translucent. Add the kale and stir together. Cook for another 3 to 5 minutes until the kale is soft and bright green and the celeriac is fork-tender. Add the vegetables to the bowl with the lentils and dressing.

      "To make the meatballs, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the eggplant, onion, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes, until the eggplant is translucent and very soft. Add garlic in the last couple of minutes of cooking. Remove from heat and set aside. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Depending on the size of your food processor, you may need to do the next step in two batches. In a food processor, pulse together the oats, 1 cup of breadcrumbs, walnuts, salt, allspice, nutmeg, and black pepper. Add the white beans and process until combined. Transfer the eggplant to the food processor, scraping in any brown bits in the pan, and pulse until everything is combined. The mixture should be fairly well-blended but retain some texture. Set the pan aside for making the gravy. Spread remaining 2 tablespoons of oil on the parchment. Place the remaining 1 cup of breadcrumbs in a small bowl. Using a tablespoon or portion scoop, shape the mixture into balls approximately 1½ inches in diameter. Place remaining breadcrumbs in a wide, shallow bowl. Roll each meatball in the breadcrumbs and arrange on the baking tray. Bake for about 30 minutes, until the meatballs are firm and crispy on the outside. While the meatballs are baking, make the gravy. Melt the butter in the eggplant pan. Whisk in the flour and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in the broth and stir until smooth and thickened. Stir in nutritional yeast, tamari, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, pepper, and salt. Gently simmer over medium-low heat until the gravy thickens, about 5 minutes. Stir in yogurt. Taste and add more salt if you like. Transfer meatballs to the pan and spoon gravy over them. Cook gently for about 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle with parsley, and serve with spiralized vegetables or your favorite noodles or mashed potatoes. Italia-tyl Tempe an Pepper"

Add the curry paste and mix thoroughly, coating the onions with the paste to help prevent clumps of curry in the sauce. Cook for another 30 seconds or so, until fragrant. Add the coconut milk, tamari, and sriracha sauce and mix well. Add the diced sweet potato. If the sweet potato isn’t covered by the coconut milk mixture, add ¼ to ½ cup water so there is enough liquid to simmer evenly. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and cover. Simmer for 10 minutes, or until nearly tender. Add the kale and chickpeas, then cover again. Simmer gently for 8 to 10 minutes, until the kale is wilted and the sweet potato is fully cooked. Stir in the chopped basil and lime juice. Serve with your choice of rice or grain and fresh lime wedges. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for three to five days. Wil Muhroo Rist "

      "Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. In a large bowl, toss the mushrooms with the oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, then spread in a single layer on the prepared tray. Transfer to the oven and bake for approximately 20 minutes, until the mushrooms have shrunken and are starting to brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. To make the risotto, while the mushrooms are roasting, heat the vegetable broth in a medium pot. Add the salt and black pepper. Taste the broth; it should taste a bit salty. Don’t worry, this extra saltiness is necessary to properly flavor the rice. If the broth you used was lowsodium, add a pinch more salt. Keep the broth hot over low heat as you continue with the recipe. Heat the oil in a wide, heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Add the shallots plus a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, and rice, and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, until the rice starts to become translucent. Add the wine and allow to cook, stirring frequently, until the wine is mostly absorbed into the rice. Add one or two ladles of hot broth to the rice and cook, stirring frequently, until the broth is almost absorbed by the rice. Adjust the heat as necessary so the risotto bubbles gently, but doesn’t boil vigorously. Add another one or two ladles of broth, and repeat this process until you’ve used all but one ladle of the broth. This will take 25 to 30 minutes. When finished, the rice will be tender all the way through but still al dente (slightly firm) in the center, surrounded by a creamy sauce. To make the stirring feel less tedious, recruit a loved one to help you out, or put on your favorite music or podcast. Stir in the roasted mushrooms, remaining broth, and cheese. Cook briefly until heated through and bubbling. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley. Eas Veg i Bake Zit"

      "Preheat the oven to 375°F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the ziti to the pot and cook according to package directions. With about 5 minutes left to cook, add the cauliflower, and bring to a gentle boil again. Continue cooking until pasta is al dente (soft with a little bite to it) and cauliflower is fork-tender. Note that the addition of vegetables will increase the stated cooking time of the pasta so check the pasta and cook accordingly. The key to success is to not overcook the pasta when boiling because it will cook again in the oven. Drain the pasta and cauliflower and return them to the pot. While the pasta is cooking, make the tofu ricotta. Finely crumble the tofu into a medium bowl. Add milk, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, olive oil, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt. Mix until all ingredients are thoroughly combined. To make the sauce, add about ⅔ of the marinara, oregano, basil, and crushed red pepper flakes to the pasta and stir to combine. Add the tofu ricotta and 1 cup of mozzarella. Stir gently. Empty the pasta into a large casserole dish and top with remaining sauce. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella. Bake for about 20 minutes until heated through and the cheese is melted. Remove from oven, garnish with parsley, and serve immediately. tuf e Potbell Pizza"

      "Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking tray with parchment. Brush the tops of the mushrooms with oil and place them oiled-side down on the tray. Sprinkle with a little salt. Roast for about 15 minutes until water is released and mushrooms are dark brown. Drain or blot excess water from each mushroom. While the mushrooms are roasting, make the tofu ricotta. Finely crumble the tofu into a medium bowl. Add nutritional yeast, lemon juice, olive oil, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt. Mix until all ingredients are thoroughly combined. After making pizzas, store any extra tofu ricotta in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to one week or in the freezer for up to three months. Spread 1 to 2 tablespoons of marinara sauce on the mushroom. Top with 1 to 2 tablespoons of tofu ricotta. Drizzle another 1 tablespoon of marinara sauce on top. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella and finish with toppings. Return the tray to the oven for about 10 minutes, or until the cheese has melted. Let mushrooms stand for a few minutes. Garnish with chopped basil before serving. Sanctuar to FULL THROTTLE I’d be lying if I said that our animal care crew cruises through winter unscathed, happily ignoring every insult that the season hurls their way. They don’t. The challenges of a tough winter—below zero temperatures, snowstorms that dump two feet or more at a time, gale-force winds—test their grit and their heart, because no matter the weather, the work of caring well for three hundred charges must still get done. Animals must be blanketed, bedding in pig houses doubled or even tripled to ensure our porcine friends’ safety and warmth, chicken wattles must be coated with Vaseline to prevent frostbite. On days like this, the animal care team is in full throttle, ensuring that even though they are struggling to stay warm, our animals are comfortable. What does full-throttle actually look like? Well, rather than blanketing the three or four most compromised horses or goats, for instance, caretakers blanket dozens of elderly animals. On the most treacherous days, our elderly and blind horses stay inside, so cleaning our twenty-stall main barn is far more difficult—there is exponentially more manure. Caretakers pile straw four feet high in the pig barn, and program overhead heaters to turn on during the bitterest hours of the long, cruel nights. Where it’s safe to hang heat lamps, they do so, and where it isn’t, chickens move into our heated offices, which adds many additional crates to the daily cleaning schedule. And there’s more to “full throttle” than the extra care the animals require. Locks and latches freeze shut and must be warmed or pried with gloveless hands, and sometimes fingers freeze to the metal itself. On days when two feet of snow has blanketed the ground overnight, Rich and Josh, our intrepid maintenance duo, alternate between snow blowing and snow plowing all day long so we have access to the thirty-five pastures and paddocks where our animals live, and Animal Care Director Kelly Mullins walks “equine alley” to determine whether it’s too icy to risk turning out the horses. Our animal care team battles stress, worry, and exhaustion, on top of the sometimes subzero gale-force winds. Still, running on empty, they smile and grit their way through. Yes. Whatever it takes to ensure that our animals are okay. That’s what “full throttle” looks like. So it was this team, already worn weary by the season itself, that found Pliers, a thirty-five-year-old horse rescued from hopelessness with his mother fifteen months earlier, down in his paddock one early February morning, pinned awkwardly against the fence. This dangerous position is referred to as being “cast,” and describes when a horse has either laid down or rolled so close to a wall or fence that he can’t get his footing to stand. Judging by his appearance (described by Health Care Manager Kellie Myers as “beyond the shivering stage”), Pliers had been down for hours. He was as still as a stone. Dr. Andrea Sotela of Rhinebeck Equine was called, and so was Kelly Mullins, Animal Care Director, who rushed in on her day off. My phone rang at 8:15 a.m. “Stevens,” said Mullins. “Are you here?” I wasn’t. I was ninety minutes away. “Pliers is down,” she said. “We don’t yet know what we’re dealing with, but we’ve got an all-hands-on-deck situation.” “I’ll take care of it,” I said, easing my car off the thruway in order to make phone calls. “And I’ll be there as soon as I can.” By the time I arrived, the barn was humming as staff and volunteers who’d dropped everything to come in on their day off cleaned stalls, filled hayracks and water buckets, and washed dishes. While the caretakers tried to save one precious life, the backup team managed the care of three hundred others. I hurried down “equine alley” and from a distance saw seven people— two vets and five staff— clustered around a prone horse; even Rich, our buildings and grounds guy, was there in case we needed the tractor to lift Pliers or, more likely, to bury him. I climbed over the gate. Another caretaker, Matt, was holding Ashley, Pliers’ blind mother, in the run-in, away from her son. Still neurotically attached to him despite remarkable progress, she’d been sedated twice. Pliers was in the middle of the paddock, covered with a thermal blanket and additional ones. Caretaker Kate, encrusted in mud, held a bag of IV fluids, the umpteenth Pliers had received that morning. Dr. Sotela ran down the scenario for me: the team had rolled Pliers over and away from the fence. They got him up. He fell. They got him up again. He fell again. He was too depleted, and the paddock, muddy from the rapid snow melt, was working against him. Dr. Sotela rattled off his body temperature (5 degrees below normal), a description of his gut sounds, the medications he’d received, the liters of fluids. And then the plan of action: more fluids, keep him settled as his body temperature rose and he recovered strength, and then three more attempts to help him stand. The first would be manual—just human strength and the will and reserves of a very old, very tired horse. If that failed, they’d attempt to lift him with heavy straps shoved under his belly. The final effort would utilize the tractor and tow straps to lift him into the air then gently lower him down, supporting him as he tried to bear his own weight. “Mullins, are you on board with this?” I asked. “Sure am,” she said with conviction. “That’s what we’re gonna do.” Sanctuary work demands that we be damned good at assessing when it’s time to let an animal go. To prolong the fight, and consequently the suffering, of an old, worn out animal is no more ethically justifiable than doing the same thing to one’s own grandparent. One needs the wisdom to know not only how possible a good outcome is, but also what the animal would want, if he could speak. And then one needs the courage to honor that choice. We give these gut-wrenching moments our very best, but once we’ve done so, and we see that the fight in a precious life is gone, then our final act of love is to let go. I looked at Pliers’s face. I watched his labored breathing. I thought about his age, and about the years of neglect and the extent to which they’d taken their toll. And I felt certain that these were Pliers’s final moments. But I hadn’t been there for the previous three hours to see what had led up to right now. More important, I trusted the wisdom and the guts of our team to know when to say, “Enough.” So while it was all I could do not to say, “I’m so sorry you disagree, but we’re done here, guys,” I didn’t. Pliers, and the team, would continue to have their shot at the unlikeliest of happy endings. I returned to the main barn, our hub. In the feed room, I organized the cleaning list: the sheep needed to be stripped; the piglets, ditto; Mario and Audrey’s barn; the goats. The list grew. I transferred it to the cleaning board in the aisle, assigned staff to various tasks, then picked up my own tools— pitchfork, shovel, rake—and loaded them into the “Daisy Duke,” our fluorescent yellow and orange work truck. I headed to one of the smaller pig barns, climbed the gate, and began cleaning. Shovel, lift, toss. Shovel, lift, toss. The barn emptied and the Daisy Duke filled, as Mario the pig kept me company. “Are you having a good day?” I asked him. “Umph,” he replied. “Umph. Umph.” As I continued cleaning, he continued chatting. I’d only been working for forty-five minutes but needed water, so I walked into the barn to discover Kelsey, our newest caretaker, putting way too many shavings in a stall. “Hey, love, you can be a little less generous,” I suggested. “Mullins told me to put down extra shavings for the horses.” “What horses?” I asked. “Ashley and Pliers.” My heart in my throat, I high-tailed it down equine alley to see ancient, blind Ashley being led from the pasture toward the main barn. And behind her, caked in mud from the tip of his ears to the bottom of his tail, came Pliers, steadied by Kate, the filthiest, happiest human I’d ever seen, taking one slow, tentative step toward the main barn. He was shaky, but very much alive. Pliers hadn’t had the energy to stand with human help, so in the end, tow straps and the long arms of the tractor bucket lifted him straight into the air and stood him on his feet. Limp when Rich had hoisted him, Pliers had the good sense to lean against the tractor for support when his feet touched the ground. There, still supported by the tow straps, he eagerly accepted hot mash and hay. Minutes passed as the crew stood surrounding him, surely as exhausted as our old boy. Eventually his shaking legs steadied. Once that happened, they removed the support straps, and then his walk to the barn began: a few steps. Rest. A few more. Rest again. His ordeal, it seemed, was over. “It’s a miracle,” was the whispered refrain, because frankly, not one of us expected this ending. But a “miracle” is not what unfolded that February morning in a muddy paddock at Catskill Animal Sanctuary. Instead, the know-how of a good vet; the guts, grace, and grit of a bone-weary animal care team; and the trust of a horse not quite ready to pack it in coalesced to allow that old boy to live to see another day. Come to think of it, maybe that is a miracle. That same night, I walked down to the barn and found Pliers snoozing in a warm barn stall, his body and psyche recovering from as much of a near-death situation as I’ve witnessed in my seventeen years of doing this work. Mama Ashley was in the stall next to him. A huge open window in the dividing wall allowed them to touch whenever they needed to. Down the aisle, Sister Mary Frances, our free-ranging potbelly pig, snored under a four-foot mound of straw and blankets. Hermione the goat called for me, and I headed down the aisle to say hello. All was well. The crew that agreed to accept Ashley and Pliers to prevent them from being shot by their owner will face more winter days like this. But they will show up, on time and smiling, to give their very best, no matter what it takes. Because that’s what they do. Just ask Pliers. The crew that cares for the animals and the Sanctuary that protects them is the “special sauce” that makes us who we are. Without their undivided loyalty to our animal ambassadors, our work to educate and inspire would fall flat. Like our Caesar dressing (pg. 188), Artichoke-Cannellini Alfredo Sauce (pg. 187), and our Peanut Butter Miso Sauce (pg. 185), they work hard to add life, flavor, and vitality to this lifesaving work. Sauce an Dressing And all at once, the meal comes to life with a drizzle or a splash— it’s all in the sauce. There are whole books to be written on sauce, but here we offer just few of ours that have accompanied the dishes in this book. Sauces and dressings are like peacemakers or instigators; they gently unite disparate ingredients or incite a riot of flavors. Use these where you see fit. Contemplate their compassionate ingredients. Then create your own sauces, and don’t keep them a secret.

Sanctuaries have known for a long time that far from being “bird-brained,” chickens are bright, multifaceted individuals. After all, we engage with them 365 days a year, so we know them as well as you know the dog who pushes you to the corner of the bed at night or the cat who stretches across your keyboard. At Catskill, our free-range “Underfoot” chickens elicit wonder, laughter, respect, and delight from those of us lucky enough to move among them each day. Truly, truly: to know chickens is to love them. Meet Sidra, for example. Sidra is a White Leghorn, the breed typically grown for its egg-laying capacity. A cheeky, active breed, Leghorns are crammed into wire cages and endure lives one wouldn’t wish upon the vilest human. Sidra is one of the lucky ones. She is smart, as are most chickens, but that’s just the start. Sidra is larger than life (all four pounds of her), living with abandon and keeping us on our toes every step of the way. Curious and exceptionally confident, Sidra loves to explore both the “Welcome Hut” and “Peabody’s Place,” a temporary space that houses our cooking demos and educational programs. The hut is the place where guests check in, but it also doubles as our retail space. As visitors shop for T-shirts, books, cards, or other Catskill memorabilia, Sidra appears to shop, too, weaving between guests, inspecting items large and small while clearly hoping some are edible. With a grand sense of entitlement, she hops onto chairs in Peabody’s Place, pecking at grains in the whole foods exhibit or watching intently as Chef Sara demonstrates how to make chicken salad sans the animal. Sidra approves. But it’s at mealtime when Sidra’s true daring emerges. She and her family—rooster Sebastian and hen Pilar—make a mad dash to the pig barn when the feed truck leaves, because they know that it is the first stop, but also because pigs eat . . . well, they eat like pigs, chomping robustly, food flying in every direction from their mouths (what they lack in finesse they make up for in gusto). Unlike Sebastian and Pilar, who hang back until the pigs are finished, Sidra defies death each time she makes a mad dash into the barn and zips around between eight hungry pigs, any of whom could crush her with a quick jerk of the head, or worse, with a “GET THE HELL AWAY FROM MY BREAKFAST!” chomp on her tiny body. No mind. She is chicken. Look the hell out. And look the hell out especially when it comes to Sidra’s task of laying eggs. With literally thousands of places to choose from (she’s a free-range bird on a 150-acre farm, for Lord’s sake) Sidra insists on a single spot: in the barn kitchen, inside a half-bag of soft pine shavings placed under the kitchen table. Why she’s so obsessively particular is curious to us, but we like to think she believes that one day, a tiny chick will emerge from one of those eggs, and what better place for a baby to be born than in a warm, soft, fluffy bed of shavings tucked under a table for protection, and in a heated kitchen, no less? We like to think, in other words, that Sidra’s behavior is maternal instinct on steroids. I was sitting in the long barn aisle, near the kitchen, my back against Callie the horse’s stall wall, when I first observed the insanity. It was just me, Russell the potbelly pig, and chickens Sebastian, Pilar, and Sidra. Russell, Sebastian, Pilar and I were chillin’. Sidra, not so much. Sidra paced back and forth, back and forth in front of the kitchen door. She was willing it to open, and she was swearing her tiny head off. Animal caretaker Crystal entered the barn. “Why is she having a meltdown?” I asked, as Sidra continued pacing like a maniac. “We’ve blocked the cat door from the other side so she can’t come in,” Crystal explained. Catskill Animal Sanctuary’s “kitchen” is located in the center of our main barn. It’s a large, high-ceilinged room where we not only prepare individualized meals twice a day, but also store everything from grain to towels to some of our medical supplies. But the inappropriately named “kitchen” is also where some of our most vulnerable birds are housed at night in safe, cozy crates bedded generously with shavings. These birds— some with injuries, some with permanent disabilities—are allowed, if appropriate, to free range during the day. But housing them in “the kitchen” is the best way to keep a close eye on them. Sidra is not one of the vulnerable, but with human traffic in and out of the kitchen all day long, she easily made it her daytime home and soon discovered the delight of laying her egg inside that bag of soft shavings intended for the crates of the other birds. She figured out in no time that if the human door was closed, then the cat door doubled as a fine chicken door, and she used it whenever she wanted to lay an egg or steal a grape from the produce containers. If Sidra’s behavior had been limited to laying eggs and pilfering produce, all would be well. But NO. Free access to the kitchen proved problematic, for when other chickens dared to share the roomy space, she pecked them, chased them, and harassed them relentlessly. A generous spirit, she is not. Underscored. So Sidra has been booted out into the barn aisle during work hours. To make matters worse, we humans foiled her Plan B. Sidra learned in a nanosecond that if the front entrance to the maternity ward (Promised Land? What else?) was blocked, she could go to the back— by traveling down the long barn aisle, circling behind the barn, walking down a little path, hopping over the washroom door, and stealthily hiding until someone opened the back door to the kitchen. But because she’s a bully, we now make sure that the top half of the washroom door is locked. Permanently. No back door entry. No front door/cat door entry. She simply can’t get in. Hence the meltdown. You’d think that with all the other options available, Little Miss Thing would choose another protected area, another bed of soft shavings. Nope. Her determination to lay her egg in the shavings . . . in the kitchen . . . under the table is all-consuming. The other day, for instance, a new volunteer named Samantha thought she was walking past a small hen perched peacefully on a shelf just outside the kitchen door when suddenly she was dive bombed by a crazed white bird. “I thought, ‘Oh, how sweet . . . that chicken feels safe enough to rest right there with humans coming in and out all day,’” Samantha explained. “But the second I opened the kitchen door, she LOST HER MIND. She came right at my head. All I could see were wings flapping and legs flailing, and then she was over my shoulder, running through the kitchen and jumping into that shavings bag.” Samantha paused to recover, and had the composure to smile. “What was that about?” she asked. I picture Sidra making her nest in the bed of shavings. Mission accomplished. It would seem Sidra’s sassy side could use a little sweetening up. And do we have just the thing! An Apple Fritter Cake (pg. 196) drizzled with sugar glaze. A Coconut Cream Pie sweet and silky enough to make you weep (pg. 203). And it’s only fair to warn you about the cheesecake. Oh, the cheesecake (pg. 215). Sidra, we’d be crabby, too, if we couldn’t eat these irresistible delights. Make them all, friends. Sweet an Treat What a tragedy life would be without the promise of something sweet. Whether it politely punctuates the end of a meal, barges into the middle of our day, or whispers to us late at night, there comes a time when we must succumb to a sweet treat. These recipes span the spectrum of humble to grand and affirm the extraordinary truth that we can indulge without animals. Cakes, cookies, tarts, or pies —they’re all here, and they’re all clamoring to be made.

      "Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly oil a 9-inch round or square baking dish. To make the filling, place apples, sugar, cinnamon, and water in a pan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes or until apples and are fork-tender. Remove from heat. To make the cake, mix applesauce, juice, sugar, oil, and vanilla together in a small bowl. In a large bowl, whisk together whole wheat and all-purpose flours, baking powder and soda, salt, cinnamon, allspice, and ginger. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix until just combined; the batter will be thick. Don’t overmix or the cake will be tough and not tender. Scoop about half of the batter into the prepared pan; spread to cover the bottom. Spoon ¾ of the apple filling evenly over cake batter. Scoop remaining batter on top and spread evenly. Distribute remaining apples on top. Bake for 55 to 65 minutes, or until the center of the cake is set. Remove from oven and set aside to cool while making the glaze. To make the glaze, sift the powdered sugar into a small bowl. Add juice and stir until smooth. The glaze should be fairly thick or else it will soak into the cake. When the cake has cooled, drizzle the glaze over the top of cake. Let the glaze set for about 5 minutes before serving. Store the cake covered in the refrigerator for several days. Blueberr Cbble"

Add the butter pieces and rub together with your hands or cut with a pastry blender until it’s the consistency of damp sand with some pea-sized pieces. Measure the milk and add the vanilla to the measuring cup, then pour it into the flour. Stir to combine, without overmixing. The dough should be thick and sticky. Plop clumps of batter on top of the blueberries, covering the most of the top but leaving some areas where the blueberries are visible. Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes. Cobbler is ready when the blueberries are bubbling around the edges and the dough is mostly firm to the touch so check after 15 minutes.

With an electric mixer, cream together the butter and almond paste until smooth and creamy. Add sugar and vanilla and mix until no bumps are visible. Add milk and beat until glossy and completely smooth. Add the flour to the mixture and sprinkle in the baking powder and salt. Mix until just combined. Using a spatula, gently fold in the raspberries. Pour batter into prepared cake pan. Bake for about 40 minutes, until the top of the cake is a dark, golden brown and puffed up. To ensure it’s done, touch the center of the cake for firmness. It should not be mushy. If the cake looks very brown and the center is not done, loosely cover it with foil and bake for another 5 to 10 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan for about 30 minutes to an hour before serving. To serve, run a sharp knife around the edge of the pan. Hold a serving plate on top of the cake pan and invert to release the cake. Turn the plate back over and slice to serve.

    "preparationSteps": [
      "To make the pie crust, preheat the oven to 325°F. Pulse graham crackers in a food processor until finely ground. In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, coconut, sugar, and melted butter, and mix well until it barely holds together when pressed between your fingers. Lightly grease a 9-inch pie plate, and spread the crust mixture evenly over the bottom and sides. Press it down evenly and firmly into the pie plate, using your fingers or the bottom of a measuring cup, covered with plastic wrap to prevent sticking. Be sure to press firmly, especially up the sides. This will ensure a stable crust. Prick the crust several times with a fork, including along the sides. Bake at 325°F for 12 to 15 minutes, until golden brown. If the crust has puffed up a bit during baking, gently press it down with a spatula to compact it. Cool completely before filling. To make the filling, combine agar flakes and water in a small pot and let sit for about 10 minutes to soften. Bring the mixture to a boil, cover, and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the agar is completely dissolved. While the agar mixture is simmering, combine the coconut milk, nondairy milk, granulated sugar, and salt in a medium pot. Whisk in the cornstarch and bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking frequently to prevent sticking. After coming to a boil, the mixture will be the texture of a thin pudding. Stir in the vanilla extract, shredded coconut, and agar mixture. Mix well. Pour the coconut custard into the prepared pie crust, smoothing out the top with the back of a spoon. Refrigerate for at least four hours, until set. To decorate the pie, spread or pipe coconut whipped cream over the pie surface and sprinkle with toasted coconut. To slice easily, dip a sharp knife in hot water, wipe with a clean cloth, and slice. Repeat for each slice for beautiful, clean slices. Froze Choclat Mous Pi"

Cover the filling with the remaining crust, and cut five or six slits in the center of the dough to allow for airflow during baking. For a fun crust, cut out small shapes using a decorative cutter. Save the little cut outs and place them whimsically around the top of the crust. Crimp the edges together to seal. Alternatively, make a lattice crust. Using a pastry wheel, cut long strips of dough from the remaining pie crust and arrange in a lattice pattern. Trim the edges of the dough with scissors and crimp the two crusts together to seal. Brush the crust with a light, even coat of nondairy milk, and sprinkle with the optional turbinado sugar for a sweet and sparkly finish. Place the baking tray in the oven and bake for 45 to 55 minutes, until the crust is golden-brown and the filling is thickened and bubbling. Remove, allow to cool on a wire rack, then serve.

      "In a medium-large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt, and whisk together to mix. Use two knives or a pastry cutter to cut the cold vegan butter into ¼-inch cubes, add to the bowl, and place the bowl in the freezer to chill for 10 minutes. Alternatively, chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to several hours. Using either a pastry cutter or two knives, cut the vegan butter into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are the size of small pebbles. Alternatively, use a food processor, pulsing a few times until the shortening pieces are the desired size. Be very careful not to allow the dough to gather up into a ball; overworking the dough will result in tough pastry. Mix together the apple cider vinegar and ice water in a small bowl, then pour over the crumbly dough, mixing together gently with a fork until the dough just holds together. Add in extra ice water as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, if the dough is too dry. Flour a work surface, gather the dough into a ball, and transfer to the floured surface. Pat the dough out into a rough circle approximately 5 to 6 inches across, then wrap the disc in plastic wrap, place in the refrigerator, and allow to chill for at least 1 hour or up to a few days. (The dough can also be frozen at this point, for later use.) Chilling the dough allows the gluten to relax, which will make the crust more tender. When you’re ready to roll the crust, flour a large piece of parchment, unwrap the chilled dough, and place the disc on the floured parchment. Sprinkle some more flour on top of the disc, then use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a circle that’s a several inches larger than your pie plate. Place the pie plate with the open surface flush against the rolled out crust, then, with one hand under the parchment and one securing the pie plate, flip everything over so the crust is sitting atop the pie plate. Gently peel off the parchment, press the crust down into the pie dish, and trim the edges. Decoratively crimp the edge however you like, or leave the edge plain if using a double or lattice crust later, and proceed with your recipe.

      "To make the crust, start by preheating the oven to 350°F. Lightly oil the tart pan and set aside until needed. Place the oats in the bowl of a food processor and process for at least one or two minutes, until the oats have been ground into a flour. Add the pecans, and pulse a few times until the pecans are finely ground and incorporated, but not oily. Add the coconut oil, maple syrup, and salt, and pulse again until the mixture holds together. It will be bit sticky, but will hold together when pressed. Transfer the mixture into the prepared tart pan, and use your fingers to spread it evenly across the bottom and sides of the pan, pressing firmly. Prick the crust evenly with a fork, then place in the preheated oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned. Set aside to cool. To make the custard, combine the coconut milk, nondairy milk, sugar, vanilla bean seeds or extract, cornstarch, salt, and turmeric in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, whisking to combine. Use a rubber spatula to stir the mixture slowly and evenly as it cooks to prevent scorching. Cook until the custard is thick and bubbling, about 7 minutes. To keep the cornstarch from breaking down and thinning out the custard, remove from the heat as soon as the custard is thickened and bubbling. Pour the custard into a bowl, cover the surface of the custard with plastic wrap to prevent a film from forming, and chill until cold, at least two hours. Overnight is fine. To assemble the fruit topping, begin by preparing your chosen fruit. For small berries, simply rinse, pat dry, and use them whole. Strawberries can be used whole if small, or sliced if larger. Nectarines and plums don’t need to be peeled, just pitted and sliced. Because of their fuzzy skins, peaches are best peeled and then pitted and sliced. Regardless of which fruits you’re using, prepare them before assembly and place them near your workstation. Whisk the chilled custard to smooth it out, adding 1 tablespoon at a time of milk if the custard is too thick to spread. Spoon into the cooled crust and spread it evenly with a spatula. Arrange your prepared fruits across the top of the custard in whatever design you like. To give the tart a beautiful shine, use a pastry brush or crumpled paper towel to dab the warmed apricot or peach jam onto the top of the fruits, coating each piece. For best results, serve within a few hours. Leftovers won’t be as beautiful, but they will still taste delicious! Ol-Fahione Poun Cak"

      "Preheat oven to 325°F. Trace the bottom of the springform pan onto parchment and cut it out. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment circle and lightly oil the sides with butter. Line a baking tray with parchment and place the pan on top; this will make clean up easier. To make the crust, break the graham crackers into a food processor and blend until finely ground. Add melted butter and pulse until the mixture resembles wet sand. Empty the crumbs into the springform pan and firmly press them evenly into the bottom and up the sides. To make the filling, place all the ingredients in a high-speed blender. Blend, while scraping down sides occasionally, for about 2 minutes, or until completely smooth and creamy. There should be no gritty texture in the mixture. To assemble the cake, pour the filling into the springform pan. Set the oven rack in the bottom position. Place the pan on a baking tray lined with parchment and put in the oven. Bake for about 50 minutes. If you notice the top is browning too much, place a piece of foil over the top of the pan without touching the filling. To make the salted caramel sauce, place the sugar in a small, heavybottomed pot. Heat over medium- high heat, while stirring occasionally. As the sugar heats, it will begin to melt and darken. When that starts to happen, you’ll need to stir it more frequently. Once the sugar is completely dissolved, remove the pot from heat and stir in the butter. When the butter is melted, place the pot back on the heat and stir in the milk. Cook, while stirring, until the mixture just starts to bubble. Keep cooking for about 1 minute after the initial boil, then remove from heat. Stir in vanilla and salt and set aside to cool. The cake is done when it is mostly firm to the touch around the outer perimeter with a slightly less done center. It will firm up further when cooled completely. Remove the cake from oven and let cool on the counter before putting it into the refrigerator to chill for several hours or overnight. To serve, cut slices and place on plates. Drizzle with salted caramel sauce and sprinkle with flaked salt. Extra caramel sauce can be stored in a sealed container for up to one month. trawberr-Peca Thumbprin Cookie"

      "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two baking trays with parchment or silicone baking mats. In a small bowl, mix together the ground flaxseed and warm water to make a “flax egg.” Allow to sit for about 5 minutes to thicken. Meanwhile, use an electric mixer to beat together the coconut oil and coconut sugar until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and “flax egg” and beat again until well-combined. Add the flour and salt to the bowl, and mix on low speed until incorporated. Stay on low speed, or use a spatula and work by hand to mix in the chopped pecans. The dough will be slightly soft and sticky. Use two spoons or a small portion scoop to portion out approximate tablespoon measures of dough. Gently roll each ball between your palms to smooth them, then place on the prepared baking trays, at least 1 inch apart. Use the palm of your hand to slightly flatten each dough ball, then use your thumb, a soup spoon, or a measuring spoon to make an indentation in the center of each cookie. If the spoon you’re using is sticking, periodically dip it in warm water as you work to prevent sticking. Fill each indentation with a small amount of preserves. Try to keep the preserves level with the top of the indentation to prevent overflow. Transfer to the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the cookies are lightly browned and the pecans smell toasty. Cool briefly on the baking trays, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. Chew Choclat Gingerbrea Cookie"

Add half the dry ingredients to the wet and mix together on low speed until well incorporated. Add the remaining flour mixture, then use a spatula to mix the batter until there’s no flour visible. Fold in the chocolate chips. The dough will be sticky, but not overly wet. Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour to make scooping and rolling easier. Using a measuring spoon or a small scoop, portion out generous tablespoon-sized balls of dough, roll between your hands to smooth them, and then roll each ball of dough in the sugar. Place the sugarcoated cookies on the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least two inches between cookies, and flatten them slightly with your hands. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until barely set and lightly cracked on the surface. These cookies firm up when they cool, so aim for a slightly undercooked texture.

In another pot, place the chocolate chips, peanut butter, and salt and allow to melt over low heat, stirring frequently to prevent scorching. The mixture is ready when the chocolate is completely melted, with no visible chocolate pieces. Spoon ⅔ of the oat mixture into the prepared baking pan, covering the bottom of the pan evenly. Use a spatula to firmly and evenly press the mixture into the pan. The more firmly the oats are pressed, the more stable the crust will be. Pour the chocolate–peanut butter mixture over the oat crust, smoothing it out with the back of a spoon. Finally, sprinkle the remaining oat mixture over the chocolate, pressing it gently into the chocolate. Transfer to the refrigerator, and chill for at least three hours or overnight. Allow to sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving. Leftovers are best kept refrigerated, then brought out again when needed. Coconu Whippe Crea"

      "To make the shells, start by making the dough. Mix the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl. Create a well in the middle and add apple juice, oil, vinegar, and almond extract. Stir to combine. When dough starts to come together, turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for several minutes until smooth and elastic. Wrap in plastic and let rest 30 minutes. To make the filling, scoop the warm potato flesh from its skin into the bowl of a food processor. Add the butter, powdered sugar, coconut cream, and salt. Blend until the mixture is creamy and smooth. Add the chocolate chips and pulse once or twice to combine. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes. To make the shells, heat the oil slowly to 375°F in a heavy bottomed pot. The oil should be about 4 inches deep. While the oil is heating, divide the dough into 4 pieces. Lightly flour the counter. Working with one piece and keeping the others wrapped in plastic, press dough into a flat rectangle, about ½ inch thick. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough until it is about the thickness of a dime. Alternatively, pass dough through the widest setting of a pasta machine, continuing to pass through narrower settings until desired thickness is achieved. Use a 3-inch cookie cutter to cut rounds from the dough. Carefully wrap each round of dough around a cannoli mold. Use a little water on the edge to gently seal the edge shut and to assure it won’t fall off during frying. With your finger, gently flare out the top and bottom edges ever-so-slightly from the mold. This will help you remove the dough from the tube after frying. Use a pair of tongs to submerge the cannoli mold in the hot oil. Fry the shell in the oil until crispy, about 1½ minutes, turning it to ensure even browning. Remove from the oil with tongs and let the oil drip back into pot before setting it down on a paper towel–lined plate to cool. When the cannoli tube has cooled enough to touch it, gently slide the cooked cannoli off and set aside on the paper towel to cool completely. It may take a little pressure to get the cannoli free from the tube, so push it down from the top rather than gripping the whole thing so as not to crush the bubbles in the fried dough. Wipe the cannoli tube to remove excess oil before using again for the next cannoli. To decorate, line a baking tray with parchment. Place chopped pistachios in a small bowl. Melt the chocolate chips in a microwave or double boiler. Dip the ends of the cannoli shell, one side at a time, into the melted chocolate to coat the edges. Place the chocolate-dipped ends into the bowl of ground pistachios, then place them on a piece of parchment. Let the chocolate harden for about 10 minutes, then the cannoli will be ready to be filled. Note that to keep the shells crisp, it is best to fill them fairly close to serving time. You can also omit the melted chocolate and just sprinkle the chopped pistachios after filling them.",
      "To fill the cannoli, scoop the chilled filling into a ziplock bag or a pastry bag with a ½-inch star or round tip. If using a ziplock baggie, fill with about ½ the filling. Snip off one corner so the opening is about ½-inch wide. Holding the cannoli shell in one hand, and the baggie or pastry bag in the other, squeeze gently and pipe the filling into one side of the shell, about halfway through. Switch sides and pipe filling into the other half so the entire shell is filled. Chill for 15 to 30 minutes and serve dusted with powdered sugar."

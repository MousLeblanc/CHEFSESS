## Slide 1: Problem — Who Hurts, How Much

### Headline
**"Collective catering groups waste 10-15 hours weekly on manual menu planning that fails to meet regulatory compliance, individual dietary needs, and budget constraints."**

### The Pain (Quantified)
- ⏰ **Time waste**: 4-6 hours per week creating menus manually
- 🚨 **Risk**: Human errors in allergy management = potential health incidents
  - **1 in 3 customers with food allergies put at risk** (BII, 2024)
  - Lack of staff training, cross-contamination, communication gaps
  - Source: https://www.bii.org/BII/BII/News/Articles/1-in-3-customers-with-allergens-put-at-risk.aspx
- 💰 **Cost**: 20-30% food waste due to poor stock management
- 📋 **Compliance**: Complex AFSCA regulations + meal sample retention = administrative burden
- 🔄 **Fragmentation**: Excel, emails, phone calls = coordination chaos
- 👥 **Scale**: Multi-site groups struggle with centralized management

### Who Hurts
- **Chefs** in nursing homes, hospitals, schools, corporate cafeterias

- **Procurement teams** coordinating with suppliers

**Impact**: These challenges cost time, money, and quality of service for residents, patients, and students.

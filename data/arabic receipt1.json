meats, such as kofta —
ground meat. This is usually
served with pita pizza.

pancakes with filling. You
can serve them open or
closed. Ashta is reminiscent
of British clotted cream, and
it is a regular feature in
Lebanese desserts but can be
difficult to get a hold of in
the United States. You can
make it yourself or replace it
with a simpler alternative.

in a pancake maker with a
bit of butter.
3.Flip the pancake with a
spatula when the
underside has a nice
golden color. Cook for a
few more seconds. Set
aside.
4.Mix walnuts, sugar, and
rose and orange blossom
water. Add a tablespoon
of the mixture in the
middle of the pancake,
and repeat this process
with a third of the
pancakes. Add a
taplespoon of ashta,
pudding on the second
third of the pancakes.
Save the last third for
open crepes (see the
following page).
5.Fold the pancakes in half
around the filling and
press at the edges so that
they stick together. Fry in
hot oil until they are
golden brown. Let the
pancakes drain off for a
little bit. Pour some of the
sugar syrup over the fried
pancakes and press at the
edges for another minute.

FRIED CONES IN SUGAR
SYRUP
ABOUT 30 PIECES
A really sweet treat, both
inside and on the outside.
These are very different
compared to the European
variation of macaroons.
4 CUPS (500 G) FLOUR
1 CUP (120 G) SEMOLINA OR
DURUM WHEAT FLOUR
1 TABLESPOON DRY YEAST
6⅓ CUPS (1V L) FRYING OIL
2 TABLESPOONS SUGAR
4 TABLESPOONS ANISE
1 TABLESPOON MAHLAB
(OPTIONAL)
1 CUP (237 ML) WATER
4 CUPS (946 ML) SUGAR SYRUP,
SEE THE RECIPE BELOW
1.Mix flour, semolina or
durum wheat flour, and
dry yeast. Add cups (355
ml) of oil and mix well.
2.Add sugar, anise, mahlab,
and hot water
(125°F/50°C). Knead to a
smooth and firm dough.
Allow to rise for 1 hour in
a warm place.
3.Divide the dough into about
30 small rectangular
pieces.
4.Press the dough pieces
against the coarse surface
of a dome— shaped grater
so that they bend. The
dough gets a pattern from
the grater. My
grandmother used to use a
wicker basket to create a
pattern.
5.Heat the remaining oil and
fry the cookies. Turn them
occasionally until they are
golden brown. Allow
them to drain and soak
them in sugar syrup for a
few minutes.
6.Serve as soon as they have
cooled.
LEBANESE SUGAR
SYRUP
¾-1¼ CUPS (200-300 ML)
This Lebanese sugar syrup is
quite thick and flavored with
rose water and orange
blossom water. Everyone
loves this syrup, and it is
used in many desserts.
1 CUP (200 G) SUGAR
1 CUP (237 ML) WATER
1 TEASPOON LEMON JUICE
1 TEASPOON ROSE WATER
1 TEASPOON ORANGE BLOSSOM
WATER
1.Dissolve the sugar in water
in a saucepan over
medium heat without
stirring.
2.Bring to a boil, and scoop
away the white foam that
forms on the surface.

minutes, then add the
lemon juice. Lemon juice
preserves the color and
prevents the syrup from
solidifying.
4.Add the rose water and the
orange blossom water.
Simmer for a few more
minutes. Allow to cool.

I want to share this recipe
with you because it contains
grape molasses, which is
such an important element in
our cuisine. It consists of
grapes that have been boiled
to form a syrup. This way all
the minerals are concentrated,
and it is a healthier and tastier
alternative to sugar. You can
replace it with sugar, but the
taste will not be quite the
same.
3 CUPS (450 G) DRIED FIGS
6 CUPS (ABOUT 1 KG) GRAPE
MOLASSES (OR 5 CUPS
GRANULATED SUGAR)
2 CUPS (288 G) SESAME SEEDS
1.Cut the figs into small
cubes.
2.Boil the grape molasses and
add the figs.
3.Simmer over low heat,
while slowly stirring. Add
the sesame seeds once the
figs have softened.
4.Allow to cool. Pour into
clean and hot glass jars.
5.Serve with desserts, on a
piece of toast, or with a
good cheese.

Orange flavor is very popular
and is used in many Arabic
sweets. Candied orange peels
are used in many desserts, but
you can also eat them as they
are.
5 ORANGES
WATER
SUGAR
1.Wash the oranges, grate the
peels lightly, and cut them
into four wedges. Remove
the pulp.
2.Place the orange zest in a
saucepan, cover with
water, and simmer until
the peels are tender. Rinse
with cold water.
3.Allow the peels to soak in
the sugar syrup for 3 to 4
days. Change the water
every day.
4.Dry and roll up the peels
lengthwise. If you want
to, you can tie a piece of
string around each peel to
prevent it from unfolding.
5.Weigh the orange peels and
measure the same amount
of sugar. Cover the bottom
of a heavy-based saucepan
with some of the sugar.
Place an orange peel on
top, and continue
alternating sugar and
peels. Gently cook over
low heat until the peels
are soft and the syrup has
thickened.
6.Take the orange peels out
of the saucepan and allow
them to cool, then roll
them in sugar and serve
with desserts, such as the
ashta pudding on page
123. Candied orange
flowers look beautiful
with any dessert.

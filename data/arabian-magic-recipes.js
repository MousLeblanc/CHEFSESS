      "For making the dough First, take a big bowl and stimulate the yeast in the warm water. It will take 10 minutes to proof. Add the olive oil, sugar, and salt into the bowl. Mix them well using a wooden spoon until combined. After a few moments, add flour to these ingredients. Mix using a spoon. Mix well until the dough is shaggy. Take the dough to some floured surface. Next, knead this dough using the hand until you get the tight ball of dough. Put the dough into an oil-coated bowl. Cover the dough using a towel or a plastic wrap. Set it aside at room temperature. It will rise in about 50-60 minutes. For making the Zaatar Spread Take a small bowl. Then, mix the olive oil and zaatar to make a spreadable and consistent mixture. Assembling and baking Preheat the oven to about 450° F. Use parchment paper to line the baking sheet. Next, make six parts of the dough. Spread every piece using your fingers and make a flat round disc with a thickness of around 1.4 inches. Put the zaatar spread ( a tablespoon or two) on each piece and spread the zaatar evenly. Place them on the baking sheet. Then, bake in the oven for 12 minutes until your dough gets golden brown. Enjoy it with vegetables and cheese.

## 🎬 1. INTRODUCTION & PROBLEM (1 minute)

### Opening Hook
> "Imagine a chef in a nursing home who has to create menus for 100 residents, each with different allergies, specific medical restrictions, while managing inventory, supplier orders, and staying within a tight budget. This is the daily reality for thousands of collective catering professionals."

### The Problem
**Current challenges in collective catering:**

- ⏰ **Time wasted**: Manual menu creation = 4-6 hours per week
- 🚨 **Health risks**: Complex management of allergies and restrictions (human errors)
- 📦 **Waste**: Poor inventory management = 20-30% food waste
- 💰 **Hidden costs**: Lack of visibility on expenses = budget overruns
- 🔄 **Fragmented processes**: Excel, paper, emails = inefficiency and errors
- 👥 **Multi-site**: Separate management of multiple facilities = administrative complexity

### Impact
> "These challenges are costly: in time, money, and especially in service quality for residents, patients, and students."

## 💡 2. SOLUTION & PRODUCT (2 minutes)

### Introducing Chef SES
> "Chef SES is the first intelligent platform that centralizes and automates all collective catering management through artificial intelligence."

### Vision

- 🧠 **AI** for menu generation

- Vulpia Group: 12 nursing home sites, 4600+ residents

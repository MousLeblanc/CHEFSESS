Add the sausages to the skillet, season them with salt and pepper and cook them for 10 minutes. It’s important you move and flip the sausages every few minutes so that they brown evenly. Then mix the cream cheese into the skillet and let it melt for 1-2 minutes. Put the cauliflower into a blender and blitz it for 30-40 seconds or until fine rice-like grains form. Remove the sausages and vegetables from the heat then pour them into a baking dish. Sprinkle half of the cheddar cheese into the dish and mix around with the sausages and vegetables. Add the cauliflower rice and remaining cheese then cover and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the bake from the oven and cook uncovered for a further 10-15 minutes. Finish with a sprinkle of parsley on top."
